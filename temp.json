He highlighted how traditional medicine can help solve global health problems and mentioned how Ayush can support health and resilience even in harsh places like the Arctic. The session was organized by India and had many respected speakers, such as Rear Admiral T.V.N. Prasanna, Polar Coordinator for India; Manish Tiwari, Scientist F at the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR); and Wassim Said, member of the Emirates Polar Program Steering Committee in the UAE. Prof. Acharya shared a future plan to strengthen cooperation between traditional knowledge and Arctic research. He suggested starting joint clinical trials in Arctic areas, creating a research consortium within the Arctic policy framework, and building skills for cross‑cultural delivery of Ayush and monitoring its safety. He also stressed the importance of publishing strong scientific evidence to link traditional and modern medicine and pushed for embedding Ayush awareness in India’s Arctic diplomatic efforts. The presence of the Ministry of Ayush delegation shows India’s commitment to bring Ayush knowledge, innovation, and diplomacy into global talks on sustainability and health. This move reaffirms India’s role as a responsible partner promoting holistic health, scientific cooperation, and people‑to‑people ties under its Arctic Policy. *** SR/GS/SG",

                    "content": "The Ministry of Ayush is continuing its promise to base traditional medicine on evidence. It is working with the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) and its Central Ayurveda Research Institute (CARI) in Bhubaneswar, together with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and its Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) in Bhubaneswar, to hold a two‑day National Seminar on \"Hepatobiliary Wellness through Ayurveda: Bridging Traditional Wisdom with Contemporary Science\" from 25 to 26 October 2025 in Bhubaneswar. The seminar’s theme is \"Yakrut Suraksha, Jiveeta Raksha\" (Protect the Liver, Preserve Life) and marks a major step toward creating research‑supported ways to care for liver and bile health. It brings together Ayurveda and modern biomedical science. Prof. Rabinarayan Acharya, Director General of CCRAS, said, \"Ayurveda offers a complete framework for liver health, focusing on prevention, balance and sustainable care. By doing joint research we are scientifically confirming Ayurveda principles and products, so we better understand how they work and how useful they are in real life. These efforts give Ayurveda global trust and open new evidence‑based options that can change how we treat the liver and improve public health.\" Dr. Sanghamitra Pati, Additional Director General of ICMR and Director of RMRC Bhubaneswar, added, \"Liver problems are complex and need cross‑disciplinary research and new ideas. Working together with Ayurveda and modern medicine creates new ways to understand disease, develop safer treatments and improve patient care. By blending old wisdom with rigorous science, we can build health models that are preventive, personalised and worldwide relevant.\" The two‑day seminar will cover five main topics and support joint research on liver and bile health. Day 1 will look at overall preventive and therapeutic approaches, including Ayurveda diet, daily routine, seasonal routine, Panchakarma and cleansing therapies, plus scientific tests and disease‑specific plans for NAFLD, Hepatitis and Liver Cirrhosis. Day 2 will focus on evidence‑based integration, showing experiments on the safety, effectiveness and workings of Ayurveda products, and plans to match Ayurveda with modern hospital practices, such as the Gut‑Liver Axis. The event will feature 58 scientific talks—22 oral and 36 posters—showing clinical results and future applications. A special session on \"Ethnomedicine in Hepatobiliary Disorders\" will highlight 20 tribal healers from Odisha, showing the Ministry’s effort to keep local medical knowledge alive. This partnership of CCRAS and ICMR shows the Ministry of Ayush’s focus on strict science, teamwork across fields and practical outcomes. By linking Ayurveda’s complete knowledge with modern research, the seminar hopes to open new paths for combined approaches to liver health and strengthen India’s global leadership in traditional medicine research. The Ministry has been working hard through CCRAS and others to scientifically prove Ayurveda for liver conditions like MASLD and hepatitis. Pre‑clinical studies on Picrorhiza kurroa (Kutaki) and Ayush‑PTK products have shown strong liver protection, while a joint study with CSIR‑CDRI in Lucknow is testing key Ayurvedic medicines against drug‑induced liver damage from ATT. A multi‑centre trial on Arogyavardhini Vati and Pippalyasava has shown good results for MASLD. A double‑blind trial is also studying the liver‑protecting effect of Ayush‑PTK in tuberculosis patients on ATT, showing CCRAS’s dedication to evidence‑based Ayurveda. The National Seminar will boost science dialogue in this area. Leading experts from modern and traditional medicine, including Prof. (Dr.) Ashutosh Biswas, Executive Director & CEO of AIIMS Bhubaneswar; Prof. Subrat Kumar Acharya, Pro‑Chancellor of KIIMS Bhubaneswar and Executive Director of Fortis Escorts, New Delhi; and Dr. Sarada Ota, Assistant Director in charge of CARI Bhubaneswar, will be present. Other distinguished scientists, doctors and teachers such as Prof. Manas Ranjan Sahoo, Dr. N. Srikanth, Dr. Ashok B. K., Dr. Rajesh Kumavat and many others will join, creating a multi‑disciplinary platform to advance liver research and integrated care through Ayurveda.",

He gave instructions for both schemes to be carried out within set deadlines. To speed up the ‘Pradhan Mantri Dhan‑Dhaanya Krishi Yojana’, he will soon hold a meeting with ministers from 11 ministries. The meeting also confirmed that the ‘Self‑Reliance in Pulses Mission’ will be run through district‑level clusters, and states are asked to help form these clusters. He also told officials to make sure the ‘Pradhan Mantri Dhan‑Dhaanya Krishi Yojana’ is effectively implemented at the village level. He said that quick action at the ground level will help farmers directly. The ‘Pradhan Mantri Dhan‑Dhaanya Krishi Yojana’, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is designed to boost farming in 100 aspirational districts by linking 36 sub‑schemes from 11 ministries. Therefore, Shri Chouhan asked officials to arrange a meeting with the ministers and secretaries of those 11 ministries, plus NITI Aayog staff, so that farmers get the most benefit. He also ordered a meeting with the main officers of the states involved in the ‘Self‑Reliance in Pulses Mission’ to ensure it runs smoothly and on time. On 11 October 2025, Prime Minister Modi launched both the ‘Pradhan Mantri Dhan‑Dhaanya Krishi Yojana’ and the ‘Self‑Reliance in Pulses Mission’ at a major event in Pusa, New Delhi. The Union Cabinet approved the ‘Pradhan Mantri Dhan‑Dhaanya Krishi Yojana’ on 16 July 2025. The scheme will run for six years, starting FY 2025–26, with an annual budget of ₹24,000 crore. The ‘Self‑Reliance in Pulses Mission’ will also run for six years with a budget of ₹11,440 crore. It aims to raise the area under pulses from 275 lakh hectares to 310 lakh hectares, increase production from 242 lakh tonnes to 350 lakh tonnes, and raise productivity to 1,130 kg per hectare by 2030–31. Along with better productivity, the mission is expected to create many jobs. ***** RC/AR",

Dedicated effort has been made to meet these targets during the Implementation Phase from 2 nd to 31 st October, 2025. All offices and officers are encouraged to dispose of E-waste properly as per government guidelines and to find new uses for the E-waste they generate. All Subordinate/Attached Offices under DA&FW are enthusiastically participating. Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institutes have made several models of equipment used by farmers from E-waste. A workshop on Public Grievances and Special Campaign 5.0 was organised by the department on 9.10.2025 with help from the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances; it was addressed by the Secretary of DA&FW and the Secretary of DARPG. Other senior officers, nodal officers for Public Grievances and the campaign, attended. Officers from the department and attached and subordinate offices under DA&FW were sensitised on the NextGen CPGRAMS portal and Special Campaign 5.0. Booklets on work allocation and submission channels in DA&FW were jointly unveiled by the secretaries. During the workshop, models of drones, tractors, cultivators etc. made from E-waste by officers and staff of various Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institutes under DA&FW were showcased. The Secretary of DARPG appreciated the officers’ efforts. The department has a strong grievance‑redressal system for farmers. The Krishi Rakshak Portal was presented in the workshop, and a 3D physical model of it was also displayed. By the middle of Special Campaign 5.0 (up to 17.10.2025), four PIB notes and more than 150 tweets had been posted by the department and its attached/subordinate/field offices on social media platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, etc. Progress and achievements of the department up to the mid‑campaign are as follows:\n1.

He thanked the FAO for its expertise and its long partnership with the Ministry, helping India become self‑sufficient in food grains, grow more varieties of crops, and make farmers stronger through new ideas and eco‑friendly ways. He said that the future must focus on nutrition‑aware farming, so everyone has healthy, varied, safe and affordable food. He noted that from being food‑poor when India first became independent, the country has now become a food‑surplus nation that feeds 1.4 billion people and plays a big part in worldwide food security. He said this change came from bold policies, science, and strong global teamwork led by the Ministry and FAO. India, a founding FAO member since 1945, shows that hunger can be cut down when farming, supply, and policy work together. He pointed out that even though India owns less than 4% of the world’s farmland and water, it has become food‑self‑sufficient and kept prices steady using public stocks and the Minimum Support Price (MSP). These systems give cheap food to more than 800 million people under the National Food Security Act, showing India’s rights‑based food security. He added that India’s farming success comes from its 146 million small farms, which keep rural life alive. Specific help such as tough seeds, cheap loans, crop insurance, and climate‑smart methods has raised yields, resilience, and farmers’ income. He reaffirmed India’s pledge to sustainability and climate change, noting projects like micro‑irrigation, integrated and natural farming, organic farming, and digital tools like AgriStack that give farmers tech and live data. The event also launched FAO’s coffee‑table book, \"Sowing Hope, Harvesting Success\", which tells FAO’s 80‑year journey and key moments in farming and related fields with India. Mr. Shombi Sharp, UN Resident Coordinator in India, and Mr. Takayuki Hagiwara, FAO Representative in India, attended. Mr. Sharp said the FAO story in India is also India’s rise as a global farming leader. Mr. Hagiwara confirmed FAO’s promise to help India reach Viksit Bharat by 2047. In line with this year’s World Food Day theme, \"Hand in Hand for Better Food and a Better Future\", the celebration brought together senior Indian government staff, UN and Rome‑based agencies, partners, and farmers from all over the country. He concluded that worldwide food problems need worldwide solutions based on local facts, and urged stronger international teamwork, open sharing of knowledge, and joint action to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). He sent warm greetings on World Food Day and wished everyone a happy, prosperous Diwali. ****** RC/AR",

Many locals, farmers, SHG members, and Panchayat representatives were there. Shri Shivraj talked about the joint work of the Central and Uttar Pradesh Governments to help farmers. He said the government is continually working to raise production, supply better seeds, and cut costs. The Minister also promised compensation under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana for crop losses. While talking to the farmers, he asked for their feedback on main crops, costs, and the need for local food shops. Shri Chouhan also explained the plan to boost lentil and gram production under the Central Government’s ‘Self‑Reliance in Pulses Mission’ and asked farmers for suggestions. He noted that this year the Central Government has raised the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Rabi crops, which will help farmers a lot.

The original deadline for Round 4 was 15th September 2025 to 14th October 2025. It was extended because many companies responded and more investment is expected. This shows growing confidence and momentum in India’s domestic production of key parts for ACs and LED Lights under the PLI‑WG Scheme. Earlier rounds of the Scheme already attracted big investment commitments, boosting manufacturing capacity and jobs across the supply chain. The PLI Scheme for White Goods was launched in April 2021 with a total cost of ₹6,238 crore. It is designed to increase local manufacturing, encourage parts made in India, and make India more competitive globally in the air conditioner and LED lighting markets. Eligible applicants can submit proposals online via the PLI portal at https://pliwg.dpiit.gov.in in the “White Goods” section by 10th November 2025. *** Abhishek Dayal/ Abhijith Narayanan/",

                    "content": "Union Minister of Commerce and Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal, said that India has changed a lot in recent years and now talks in trade deals from a strong position. He spoke at the 105th Annual General Meeting of ASSOCHAM in New Delhi. He said that India now works mainly with countries that are not competitors, so trade deals are fair and help both sides. This strategy protects our local industries, boosts exports, and opens chances for investment and technology sharing. It also avoids deals that would mainly help the other side. He mentioned that India’s foreign exchange reserves are still strong, about USD 700 billion, showing a healthy economy. He said that people, businesses, and industry in India now show new energy and confidence that we did not see a few years ago. The world now sees India as an important trade partner. He said that the days when India negotiated from a weak position are over. India’s passport now has respect and value worldwide. Shri Goyal said that while the world faces tough times, India keeps growing fast. He mentioned the IMF projection that raised India’s growth forecast from 6.4% to 6.6% and that retail inflation in September was the lowest in eight years at 1.54%. He said that India no longer signs unfair free trade agreements. The economy is ready for present and future challenges, guided by a clear vision and a nation‑first approach. He recalled the five principles (Panch Pran) the Prime Minister spoke about on 15 August 2022, which set the path to make India a developed country by 2047. He explained that the free trade agreements with Mauritius, Australia, the UAE, and the European Free Trade Association are a new chapter in India’s trade. These deals are balanced, keeping India’s priorities and long‑term goals first. These countries do not compete with India in key manufacturing sectors, so Indian businesses get better market access without unfair competition. The agreements open opportunities for exporters, bring high‑income markets, encourage investment, and allow advanced technology flows. They aim to promote industry collaboration, improve supply‑chain resilience, and help India become a global manufacturing hub. They also have strong rules for innovation, research, and skill development so Indian firms stay competitive. The government has protected India’s interests in these deals, especially in sensitive sectors. Through these trade pacts, India strengthens its position and promotes fair and sustainable growth. The government works to make India attractive for business by easing rules, simplifying processes, and reducing red tape. Shri Goyal said India is committed to sustainability, having already built 250 GW of renewable energy, 50% of the national grid. By 2030 India will reach 500 GW of clean energy, making it a top place for data centres and green investments. He highlighted that services are India’s core strength and expects service exports to soon exceed merchandise exports. The service sector creates jobs, drives the economy, and boosts demand for goods and services. The government is working with start‑ups that recycle waste for rare earths like loam and aldo, and plans to set up processing plants in India, a field currently concentrated in few places. He urged stakeholders to keep checking and strengthening their supply chains. Recent disruptions show the need for secure, diverse, self‑reliant networks. India must examine every link—from raw material to production and distribution—to cut dependence on a few areas and reduce risks. The government encourages industry to map supply chains and find ways to build domestic capacity. With public‑private cooperation, India can create strong value chains that meet domestic demand and serve the global trade system. This fits the “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” vision of self‑reliance and deeper integration into global value chains. Shri Goyal has spoken with many Export Promotion Councils and industry groups, urging them to strengthen supply chains with innovation, local manufacturing, and efficient logistics. He said India should build flexibility in trade systems to respond to future challenges. He said the MSME sector faces challenges and that groups like ASSOCHAM can help solve them. He praised ASSOCHAM for engaging start‑ups, MSMEs, and industries and being a key partner in policy dialogue, trade facilitation, and international cooperation. With resolve, teamwork, and commitment, India can keep overcoming challenges and move toward being a developed, self‑reliant nation by 2047.",

It will bring together producers, exporters, importers, policymakers, financiers, logisticians, research institutions, and other service providers to improve transparency, efficiency, and resilience in the global rice trade. The main topics will be sustainability, innovation, and rules‑based trade.\nAt the opening of BIRC 2025 in New Delhi, APEDA Chairman Shri Abhishek Dev said that the foreign ministers of the Philippines, Ghana, Namibia, and The Gambia will join the two‑day event. India is one of the world’s biggest rice producers and exporters, sending rice to more than 172 countries. BIRC 2025 gives stakeholders a chance to strengthen their role in global food supply chains. The conference is organized by the Indian Rice Exporters’ Federation (IREF), which represents more than 7,500 exporters in India, together with the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA). APEDA is a statutory body under the APEDA Act, 1985, that promotes exports of about 800 agricultural products, including rice. The conference has support from many ministries, departments, and state governments.\nSupporting institutions include the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Ministry of Food Processing Industries, Ministry of Cooperation, and Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. The states of Odisha, Telangana, Meghalaya, Assam, and Manipur also support the event. Other partners are the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and cooperative groups like National Cooperative Exports Limited (NCEL), National Cooperative Organics Limited (NCOL), Bhartiya Beej Sahakarita Samiti Ltd. (BBSSL), and Krishak Bharati Cooperative Agri Limited (Kribhco).\nMore than 3,000 farmers and Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), more than 1,000 foreign buyers from over 80 countries, and 2,500 exporters, millers, and related businesses are expected to join. BIRC 2025 will launch a Vision & Roadmap document that gives detailed action plans for the rice sector, matching the Ministry’s long‑term policies. Stakeholders will meet in panel discussions with experts, policymakers, industry leaders, trade groups, and research institutes to shape the Vision & Action Plan. The final document will be prepared over the next six months using the results from technical sessions, consultations, and expert talks at the conference.\nThe Department of Commerce will coordinate the process with APEDA, IREF, partner ministries, and top research bodies like ICAR and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), plus major cooperative societies and state governments. Eight technical sessions will be held over the two days to build the Vision & Roadmap. Senior officials and top experts will chair the sessions.\nIndia made about 150 million tonnes of rice in 2024–25 on almost 47 million hectares, about 28 percent of the world’s total. Yields rose from 2.72 tonnes per hectare in 2014–15 to about 3.2 tonnes per hectare in 2024–25, thanks to better seeds, better farming practices, and more irrigation.\nIn FY 2024–25, India exported 20.1 million metric tonnes of rice worth about USD 12.95 billion to over 172 countries. BIRC 2025 points out that rice is a key part of global food security. Since 1961, rice production has tripled from 216 million tonnes to almost 776 million tonnes. More than four billion people rely on rice for food and income, and about 150 million small farmers grow it in over 100 countries. The world rice market is worth about USD 330 billion and is the third biggest traded food item.\nRice farming uses a lot of resources, about 24–30 percent of global irrigation water and around 167 million hectares. The conference will discuss new ideas in farming, irrigation, certification, and traceability to make the sector more sustainable and cut its environmental impact. BIRC 2025 will have many themed activities and sessions.\nA coffee‑table book that shows India’s rice heritage, including Basmati and non‑Basmati types, historic GI stories, farmer stories, and new ideas, will be launched. BIRC 2025 seeks to open ₹1.80 lakh crore worth of new import markets and sign ₹25,000 crore in export agreements. A Culinary Experience Zone, organized by IREF, APEDA, IRRI, and ITC Hotels, will let chefs show how Indian rice can be used in global dishes. Taste tests and buyer clinics will evaluate quality and preferences, and quick export registration will turn interest into trade agreements. The program shows that Indian rice is a genuine, high‑quality option for many cuisines, helping reach ₹1.80 lakh crore in markets and ₹25,000 crore in exports.\nTABLE 1: Markets where Indian rice can be promoted\nRank  Importing Country  Imports from competitors (USD mn)\n1  Indonesia  2,586\n2  Philippines  2,470\n3  Saudi Arabia  497\n4  Vietnam  1,463\n5  Iraq  1,661\n6  USA  1,194\n7  Malaysia  872\n8  Côte d’Ivoire  849\n9  China  890\n10  UK  528\n11  Benin  218\n12  France  652\n13  UAE  190\n14  Brazil  678\n15  South Africa  520\n16  Belgium  602\n17  Japan  623\n18  Mexico  617\n19  Senegal  373\n20  Germany  454\n21  Kenya  337\n22  Cameroon  341\n23  Mozambique  384\n24  Canada  341\n25  Netherlands  341\n26  Korea  409\nObjective: Shift a useful portion of these purchases to Indian rice using product‑market fit demos and quick contracts.\nTABLE 2: Dishes by Country and Suggested Indian Rice Types\nS.No  Country  Dish(es)  Suggested Indian Variety\n1  Indonesia  Nasi Goreng  Nagri Dubraj\n2  UK  Kedgeree, Fried rice  Nagri Dubraj, Wayanad Jeerakasala (Kaima)\n3  USA  Jambalaya, Gumbo  Kola Joha, Govindobhog, Kalanamak\n4  Vietnam  Cơm chiên (fried rice)  Govindobhog, Nagri Budraj, Wayanad Jeerakasala\n5  Malaysia/Singapore  Nasi Ayam  Mushk Budji\n6  Japan  Sushi, Donburi  Mushk Budji, Chakhao (Black rice), Chakhao White rice, Kalajeera / Adamchini\n7  China  Kimchi fried rice, Chicken sticky‑rice dim sum  Adamchini, Khao Tai (Khamti), Chakhao White rice, Sticky rice dumpling (Chinese), Chakhao White rice, Khao Tai (Khamti)\n8  Saudi Arabia  Kabsa  Wayanad Jeerakasala (Kaima), Nagri Dubraj\n9  Mexico  Rice & cheese stuffed burritos  Lal Dhan (Red rice), Wayanad Jeerakasala (Kaima)\n10  Korea  Bibimbap  Chakhao (White), Khao Tai (Khamti)\n11  Philippines  Arroz Caldo  Kalanamak / Kalajeera, Khao Tai (Khamti)\n12  Iraq  Timman bil Jazar (chicken & carrot rice)  Nagri Dubraj\n13  Côte d’Ivoire  Riz gras  Kola Joha\n14  France  Riz forestier (mushroom risotto style)  Mushk Budji\n15  India  Dum Pukht Biryani  Basmati India\n16  India  Payasam  Govindbhog, Kalanamak, Musqbudgi\nBIRC 2025 will have an AgriTech Pavilion that will launch and demo India’s first AI‑based sorting machine at Bharat Mandapam, Pragati Maidan, on 30–31 October 2025. This new system uses Artificial Intelligence and Big Data to look at colour, shape, size, and structure of rice grains all at once. It can sort by colour and separate broken grains in one step. The technology offers better accuracy, faster work, and lower cost, using less power, fewer workers, and less space.\nA Women Entrepreneurs, Startups and MSME Pavilion will display new ideas for all parts of farming. It will show seed development, climate‑smart farming, post‑harvest tech, milling and colour grading, packaging and branding, quality checks using QR codes and blockchain, online markets, and financial products. The pavilion will have live demos, mentorship talks, and chances to start exporting for new businesses.\nPavilions from Jammu & Kashmir, Manipur, Telangana, Odisha, Meghalaya, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Haryana will show their GI and special rice types, eco‑friendly farming, processing facilities, transport routes, investment opportunities, and ways to meet buyers.\nMeghalaya’s government will join BIRC 2025 to show its traditional rice types like Pnah Iong (Black Sticky Rice), Mynri (Golden Rice of Ri‑Bhoi), Mangsang Rice, Minil, and Khaw Biriun. These are grown in eco‑friendly, rain‑fed ways, showing the state’s focus on organic farming.\nMeghalaya’s role matches its State Rice Mission and the Integrated Basin Development and Livelihood Programme (IBDLP). These programs aim to raise crop output, add value, and improve market access for small farmers and protect native rice varieties.\nTelangana will show how it has become a big centre for top‑quality rice exports. Good policies and new infrastructure help it. Paddy output grew from 68.17 lakh tonnes in 2014–15 to about 277.67 lakh tonnes in 2024–25, making Telangana important for India’s export farming. The state will talk business and display its best varieties, like Telangana Sona (RNR 15048), BPT 5204 (Samba Mahsuri), MTU 1010, and KNM 1638, for foreign buyers.\nBharat Organics, part of National Cooperative Organics Limited (NCOL), will launch its Organic Rice line and a Direct‑to‑Consumer platform at BIRC 2025. The line has two main types—Traditional Basmati and Traditional Brown Basmati—plus ten single‑origin varieties like Kala Namak (Uttar Pradesh), Indrayani (Maharashtra), Gobindobhog (West Bengal), Black Rice (Manipur), and Red Matta.\nBharat Organics wants to give certified, farmer‑direct, chemical‑free rice, while keeping trade fair, transparent, and helping small farmers get better markets.\nThe Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) will show its Trade Connect e‑Platform at the event. The site gives exporters one online place to get Certificates of Origin, tariff details for each country, listings of trade shows, product and market guides, and tools to link with overseas buyers and make personal microsites for better visibility.\nBIRC 2025 will also sign an agreement to set up an Incubation and Agricultural Research Centre in New Delhi. The centre will work on sustainable and climate‑smart rice farming, researching seeds, growing, and post‑harvest care. Agreements will also help place agricultural graduates into research jobs, boosting innovation and jobs in farming research.\nICAR and IRRI will run a farmer training session at the event, teaching sustainable practices. The lesson will cover climate‑smart farming, efficient water use, and soil health to increase yield and protect the environment.\nFrom now on, BIRC will be held every year as a leading platform for global interaction, policy talks, and cooperation in the rice chain. IRRI South Asia Regional Centre (IRRI‑SARC) in Varanasi is the research partner, and E&Y and S&P Global are knowledge partners.\nCountries partnering in the event are the Philippines, Myanmar, Niger, Comoros, Jordan, Liberia, The Gambia, and Somalia. *** Abhishek Dayal/ Abhijith Narayanan/ Nihi Sharma/ Ishita Biswas",

Under this program, medicines will be bought and packed by Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) at the Common Service Centre (CSC) located at ECHS polyclinics. Delivery will be handled by India Post’s delivery network. This will ensure that medicines reach ECHS beneficiaries quickly, safely, and everywhere in the country. The service was first tested in Delhi on 31 July 2025 and received a positive response. It was then extended to the NCR area, covering Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. After the pilot delivered more than 1700 medicine packets, a full mapping of 458 ECHS locations across the country has been completed. The service will be available nationwide from 17 October 2025. This initiative shows how the Department of Posts uses its postal network for welfare projects and public service. The service will provide timely and reliable delivery of medicines to ECHS beneficiaries, confirming India Post’s role as a trusted partner in building the nation and helping citizens. ***** Samrat / Allen",

                    "content": "Union Minister for Communications and Development of North Eastern Region, Shri Jyotiraditya M. Scindia, held a press conference today to talk about what the Ministry of Communications has achieved. He spoke about the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and Department of Posts (DoP). Dr. Chandra Sekhar Pemmasani (Minister of State of Communications), Dr. Neeraj Mittal (Secretary of Department of Telecommunications) and Smt. Vandita Kaul (Secretary of Department of Posts) were also present.\n\nIn his opening, Mr. Scindia said India is no longer just a follower in telecom. He said, 'India has become a leader in telecom, in both services and products.' He added that the number of customers and the optical fibre network have grown many times. Internet and broadband connections have also increased a lot.\n\nHe said that if we look at scale, no one matches India. India would be the third largest digital nation if we count all digital use. The Prime Minister’s vision 11 years ago to create a digital highway is now a reality. He called BSNL’s turnaround one of the most impressive achievements. After 18 years BSNL made a profit, with ₹262 crore in Q3 and ₹280 crore in Q4 of FY2024‑25. BSNL’s EBITDA rose to ₹5,395 crore and losses dropped from ₹5,400 crore to ₹2,400 crore.\n\nThe country has also launched a fully indigenous 4G stack, a big breakthrough that puts India among a few countries that can build telecom technology from scratch. In the ‘100% telecom saturation’ mission, India has reached 75% of its goal in one year. Out of 17,000 towers planned, about 13,000 are already installed. In the district scheme, 81% coverage has been achieved. In Left‑Wing Extremism (LWE) areas, coverage went from 0% to 57% in Phase‑I and from 74% to 87% in Phase‑II. For island areas coverage improved from 38% to 84%.\n\nTo speed up projects, the ministry made a real‑time dashboard to track land, forest and security issues. Mr. Scindia also highlighted advances in telecom security. AI tools like ASTR have cut more than 82 lakh fake mobile connections, and the Financial Fraud Risk Indicator stopped scams worth almost ₹200 crore. ‘Google has joined this effort, which is a huge boost,’ he said. A unified Digital Intelligence Platform (DIP) now lets over 750 government and private groups share data, including all state governments, banks and police.\n\nTRAI now reports service quality every month instead of every quarter. Operators must make tower maps public and meet targets such as less than 2% drop‑call rate and latency under 50 ms by April 2026. The ministry also set up a single‑window portal to speed right‑of‑way approvals, cutting the average time from 448 days in 2019 to just 33 days in 2025.\n\nMr. Scindia said the ministry is moving toward accountability and teamwork. ‘Every BSNL Chief General Manager is now a CEO of their area, setting and reviewing quarterly targets,’ he said. The DoT also held a ‘9‑to‑9’ marathon review meeting to check performance and share best practices. He said India’s telecom story is about transformation, resilience and leadership.\n\nSecretary (T) Dr. Neeraj Mittal added that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visionary leadership, the Department of Telecommunications has worked with the spirit of Samaveshit (inclusion), Tvarit (speed), Surakshit (security) and Viksit (development) to ensure that no citizen, village or enterprise is left behind in India’s digital journey. Mr. Scindia concluded that the ministry is committed to universal connectivity, indigenous innovation, citizen protection and global leadership. ‘Digital Bharat continues to inspire the world as a model of inclusive growth, with secure, self‑reliant and innovative telecom at its backbone,’ he said.\n\nThe past year has been extraordinary for @DoT_India, @IndiaPostOffice and @MDONER_India, marked by reforms, inclusive growth and new steps in service for every citizen of Bharat.

To support the campaign, the Director General Telecom (DGT HQ), DoT, held an informative webinar on 24th October 2025 to build a culture of cyber awareness and resilience online. The webinar gathered experts and professionals from the telecom sector to discuss new cyber threats, governance problems, and ways to make organisations resistant to phishing. The event was attended by Ms. Sunita Chandra, Director General Telecom, Sh. Suresh Puri, Additional Director General, DGT HQ, and other senior officers from DGT HQ and DoT HQ. About 250 people from DoT field units, Telecom Service Providers, and Internet Service Providers joined the webinar, showing strong interest in the telecom community. DG Telecom stressed that everyone must take responsibility and be aware to keep cyberspace safe, and the Addl. DG updated participants on the progress of setting up the Telecom-CSIRT and the readiness of DoT field units. Cyber Security Expert Dr. Rohit Gautam noted that phishing is still the most common and harmful cyberattack, making up almost 90% of breaches worldwide. He explained that attacks that target people, like phishing, vishing, and deepfake frauds, keep taking advantage of user trust and cost more than $9.5 trillion each year worldwide. Key lessons were how to spot social engineering attacks, recognise suspicious messages, and see real examples of homograph and AI-powered phishing. Industry Expert Sh. Abhijit Tripathy explained that Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) is the foundation of an organisation’s cyber resilience. He simplified GRC ideas and showed how people, processes, and technology can work together to improve security. Cyber Security Expert Sh. Sampat Ray talked about new mobile cyber threats and phishing. He pointed out the rapid growth of AI-enabled malware, fake mobile apps, and voice phishing (vishing) scams that hit people and businesses. He also explained the rise of advanced phishing using deepfake audio and AI messages and shared ways to stop these threats. The webinar clearly showed how collective responsibility, smart decisions, and constant vigilance are needed to protect the country’s telecom infrastructure.

The new VOPPA Order, 2025 is meant to give better control and more openness in India’s edible oil sector. Under the new order, all companies that produce, process, blend, re-pack, or otherwise deal with edible oil must register with the VOPPA Order and submit monthly reports of their production and stock through the special online portal. This rule change is essential to collect accurate data, monitor the market in real time, and improve policy decisions. It supports the Government of India’s effort for food security and stronger supply chains. The response from the edible oil industry is encouraging. Many oil units across the country have already signed up on the National Single Window System portal and are regularly sending their monthly returns at https://www.edibleoilindia.in. This shows that industry players are committed to transparency and compliance. All units that produce, process, blend or re-pack edible oil must do the following under the new VOPPA Order: - Register through the National Single Window System at https://www.nsws.gov.in. - Then file monthly production, stock, and availability returns at https://www.edibleoilindia.in. If a unit does not register or submit returns, it will be treated as a violation. Those units will face penalties under the new VOPPA Order and the Collection of Statistics Act, 2008. To enforce this, the Department plans to carry out inspections and verify non-compliant units on the field. These checks will show the seriousness of compliance and keep the national data system reliable for the edible oil sector. Compliance with the new order is not just a rule—it is a critical part of India’s food security system. The initiative helps better planning, informed decisions, and creates a smoother and clearer edible oil market. The Department urges all stakeholders to comply as soon as possible and to help build a strong, reliable, data-driven edible oil sector in the country.

After paying respect to the relics at the famous Geden Sheddup Choikorling Monastery, called the \"Golden Abode of Shakyamuni Buddha,\" he said that this event is a big return of faith for the Kalmyk people, the only Buddhist nation in Europe. It shows a strong spiritual friendship between India and Russia and highlights India’s cultural ties.\n\nHe gave a \"Khatak\" to the relics and lit a lamp in the temple. He also offered prayers and presented a \"Khatak\" before Bakula Rinpoche. He gave a Kashmiri shawl to Shajin Lama and received blessings.\n\nOn Friday, the Lieutenant Governor arrived in Russia to bring the relics back to India after their show in Elista, the capital of the Republic of Kalmykia. He was welcomed by Tserenov Erdni Nikolayevich, the First Deputy Chairman of the Government of Kalmykia, Dzhambinov Ochir Vladimirovich, and India’s Deputy Chief of Mission Shri Nikhilesh Giri. The group will bring the relics back to India on October 19th 2025.\n\nEarlier, he announced his trip to Kalmykia, saying he would lead the team to return the holy relics. He posted on X: \"Leaving for Kalmykia, Russia, where I will lead the delegation to bring back holy relics of Lord Buddha after a week‑long exhibition. I sincerely thank Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for this sacred opportunity. ‘Om Mamo Buddhaya’.\n\nThe exhibition of the sacred relics has attracted an unprecedented response in Kalmykia. Over Ninety Thousand devotees have visited the relics at the Geden Sheddup Choikorling Monastery. The relics, a National Treasure of India, were brought to Elista by a high‑level delegation led by Shri Keshav Prasad Maurya, Deputy Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, and senior Indian monks. The delegation has held special prayers and blessings for Kalmykia’s largely Buddhist community.\n\nThis first‑ever exhibition in the Russian Republic shows the deep cultural bond between India and Russia and revives the legacy of 19th‑century Buddhist monk and diplomat Kushok Bakula Rinpoche, who helped bring Buddhism back to Mongolia and interest in the Buddha’s teachings in places like Kalmykia, Buryatia, and Tuva.\n\nThe event is organized by the BTI section of the Ministry of Culture, Government of India, with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), the National Museum, and the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA).

                    "content": "\"India must produce rare materials used in defence and aerospace to become a technology creator and safeguard its technological sovereignty,\" said Defence Minister Shri Rajnath Singh. He dedicated a Titanium and Superalloy Materials Plant at PTC Industries’ Strategic Materials Technology Complex in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh on October 18, 2025.\n\nHe highlighted that Rare Earth Materials are essential for defence, space, electronics and other sectors, and only a few countries can refine them into high‑end products. The newly opened plant, one of the first private‑sector units to make aero‑engine parts and super‑alloy components, will help India produce these rare materials.\n\nThe Minister noted that India previously depended on other countries for advanced materials and critical technologies needed for defence and aerospace, which slowed the sector’s growth. The new plant marks a change in this trend. He added that India’s true strength comes when it can make its own materials, components, chips and alloys. The plant places India among a select group of nations that can produce their own critical defence and aerospace materials.\n\n\"With this, we can manufacture parts used in our fighter jets, missiles, naval systems and satellites,\" he said.\n\nHe stressed that while technology is power, material is the real strength. Whether it is a semiconductor chip, bullet material or engine turbine part, none is possible without strategic materials.\n\n\"We are building a foundation that will strengthen India’s technological independence in the coming years,\" he added.\n\nCalling the plant a living example of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, he said it will benefit not only the industry but society as a whole. It creates an innovation chain that will achieve the goal of Aatmanirbhar Bharat in the defence sector and give fresh momentum to the state economy.\n\nOn the Complex, he expressed confidence that it adds a new dimension to Uttar Pradesh’s industrial map. The complex, with ancillary units and supplier industries, will create direct and indirect jobs in the state. He added that the UP Defence Industrial Corridor will be among the most advanced manufacturing zones in Asia, linking to start‑ups and MSMEs, providing jobs for youth and opportunities for training.\n\nHe praised Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for the state’s progress in becoming an industrial leader over the last 10 years. Improved law and order has boosted investor confidence and factories, IT hubs and research centres are being set up, making the state the country’s growth engine.\n\nHailing India’s changed mindset, he said, \"We are entering a new era and have moved beyond Make‑in‑India to Design, Develop and Deliver in India.\" He highlighted the private sector’s role in defence production and research, saying any goal is possible if industry and government work together.\n\nHe called on youth, innovators, MSMEs and start‑ups to seize opportunities in the defence sector as a responsibility to the nation. The current work will inspire a new generation of innovators.\n\nHe recognised progress in public‑private partnership in defence manufacturing and promised government policy support and cooperation to stakeholders in India’s defence and aerospace sector. He urged all stakeholders to pursue the goal of making India a global defence manufacturing hub through innovation, dedication and passion.\n\nEarlier, he toured the Complex with Yogi Adityanath, Deputy Chief Minister Brajesh Pathak, Secretary of the Department of Defence R&D, Chairman DRDO Dr Samir V Kamat and DG (BrahMos) Dr Jaytirth R Joshi. The dignitaries were briefed on the facilities by PTC Industries’ Chairman and Managing Director Shri Sachin Agarwal.\n\nAn MoU was signed between PTC Industries Limited and Bharat Dynamics Limited to form a joint venture for design, development and manufacture of propulsion systems, guided bombs and small aeroengines for missiles, UAVs and loitering munitions. The collaboration aims to use both organisations’ strengths and accelerate indigenisation of advanced propulsion technologies, reducing import dependence and strengthening India’s defence manufacturing base.\n\nPTC Industries received a Letter of Technical Acceptance from the Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification under DRDO for the indigenous development and manufacture of the Titanium Rear Fin Root Casting for the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft program. Developed with the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory and the Aeronautical Development Agency, this marks a critical step in India’s ability to produce structural castings for next‑generation fighter aircraft.\n\nPTC Industries also received a Letter of Technical Acceptance for the indigenous development and manufacture of Oil Tank Assembly Titanium Castings for the Kaveri Derivative Engine. This will be executed with the Gas Turbine Research Establishment.\n\nFurthering its collaboration with GTRE, PTC Industries received a Purchase Order for Post‑Cast Operations to produce Single Crystal Ready‑to‑Fit Turbine Blades for the Kaveri Derivative Engine. This marks an important step in India’s capability to produce single‑crystal turbine blades, a complex and high‑value component in modern jet engines.\n\nSpread over 50 acres, the Strategic Materials Technology Complex was built with an investment of Rs 1,000 crore. With a production capacity of over 6,000 tonnes per annum, the plant enables India to produce aviation‑grade Titanium and Superalloys from domestic and recycled sources – a decisive move toward strategic material independence.\n****** VK/SPS/Savvy",

The new facility, part of the UP Defence Industrial Corridor, was opened virtually by Raksha Mantri on May 11, 2025, and in five months the first missiles were ready to use. He said BrahMos is more than a missile; it shows India’s growing ability to make its own defence tools. The missile has a traditional warhead and a modern guided system and can travel long distances at supersonic speed. Its speed, accuracy and power make it one of the best systems in the world. It is now a key part of our Armed Forces. He also spoke about BrahMos in Operation Sindoor, saying the missile has proven it is not just a test but a strong proof of national security. Every part of Pakistan’s land can now be reached by BrahMos. Operation Sindoor shows we can win every time, and we must keep improving. The operation was only a preview. It has shown Pakistan what may come next.\n\nRaksha Mantri said India is now stronger in security and shows the world it is a reliable partner in defence and technology. Achievements like BrahMos prove that Made-in-India is more than a slogan; it is a global brand. Whether we export BrahMos to the Philippines or help other countries, India is now a giver, not just a taker. This is the real spirit of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, a vision that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi-led Government started in 2014. PM Modi has shown us a vision of an India that is fully developed, self-reliant and ready to lead the world by 2047. Defence will play a key role.\n\nShri Rajnath Singh told us that the BrahMos team has signed contracts worth about Rs 4,000 crore with two countries in the last month. He added that in coming years experts from many countries will visit Lucknow, making the city a knowledge hub and leader in defence technology. The Lucknow unit of BrahMos will turnover about Rs 3,000 crore next year and collect about Rs 500 crore in GST.\n\nThe 200-acre facility was built for Rs 380 crore. Raksha Mantri said it is not just a defence plant but also a new source of jobs and growth. About 100 missile systems will be made each year. With the investment coming to Uttar Pradesh and the progress in the state, the region will become a symbol of a new era of growth and defence.\n\nHe pointed to reports of supply chain issues in other countries and said we need to strengthen small industries that make thousands of parts needed for a large weapon system so we rely less on others. As technology grows, supply chains diversify. These chains often link to other countries. If a person, company or country refuses to give a spare part, the product cannot be made. We must strengthen small industries so we do not rely on others for spare parts. Whether it is advanced seekers or ramjet engines, we must develop all technology in India so our supply chain stays inside India.\n\nRaksha Mantri urged a clear project plan to bring small entrepreneurs into the defence system. The UP Defence Industrial Corridor will succeed only when small industries grow with big companies. I am sure that in the future UP will be a manufacturing hub and a new centre for innovation and jobs for entrepreneurs, big and small.\n\nShri Rajnath Singh added that places like the BrahMos Integration and Testing Facility Centre boost both security and the economy. The government gets a lot of GST from the missiles being delivered, which shows each missile protects the nation and also helps the economy. From the taxes of one missile, the government can build many schools, set up many hospitals and run programmes that benefit people.\n\nIn his speech, the UP Chief Minister called BrahMos a missile of Aatmanirbharta, meeting the country’s defence needs. He thanked Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh for giving Lucknow the chance to join the movement toward self-reliance in defence by making BrahMos missiles. The Chief Minister said missiles made in Lucknow assure safety and prosperity for the nation. He praised progress in all six nodes of the UP Defence Industrial Corridor, noting more than 15,000 youth have jobs in the state.\n\nThe BrahMos facility is a major project under the UP Defence Industrial Corridor. It does all steps of assembly, integration and testing to high technical standards. With its first missile shipment, Uttar Pradesh is now a key partner in the ‘Make in India, Make for the World’ program. The Lucknow unit is the first in the corridor to handle the full manufacturing and testing process in India, strengthening strategic independence and industry growth.\n\nShri Rajnath Singh and Shri Yogi Adityanath also opened the Booster Building and saw a live demo of the booster docking. They also reviewed presentations at the Airframe and Avionics, Pre-Dispatch Inspection and Warhead Buildings, and the BrahMos simulator. A mobile autonomous launcher was also shown.\n\nDG (BrahMos) Dr Jaytirth R. Joshi gave the GST bill and a cheque of about Rs 40 crore to the UP Chief Minister, showing revenue for the state. UP Deputy Chief Minister Shri Brajesh Pathak and Secretary, Department of Defence R&D and Chairman DRDO Dr Samir V Kamat were also present.\n\n*** VK/SPS/Savvy",

                    "content": "Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh, on October 21, 2025, placed a wreath at the National Police Memorial in New Delhi for Police Commemoration Day. That day in 1959, 10 brave policemen gave their lives when Chinese troops with heavy weapons ambushed them at Hot Springs, Ladakh. In his speech, the Raksha Mantri praised the fallen heroes and thanked the police and paramilitary forces for their service to the nation. He said the armed forces and police are pillars of national security. While the armed forces protect the country and its borders, the police protect society and its values. “The military and police work on different levels, but their goal is the same – to protect the nation. As we aim for Viksit Bharat by 2047, balancing external and internal security is more important than ever,” he added. On current challenges, Shri Rajnath Singh noted that along with border instability, new kinds of crime, terrorism, and ideological wars are emerging inside the country. He said crime has become more organized, hidden, and complex, and its aim is to create chaos, erode trust, and threaten national stability. He praised the police for preventing crime and for maintaining public trust. “If people sleep peacefully today, it is because they trust our vigilant armed forces and alert police. This trust is the basis of our country’s stability,” he said. He also highlighted that Naxalism had been a long‑term internal security problem. He said the joint efforts of police, CRPF, BSF, and local governments have stopped the problem from worsening, and people in areas affected by left‑wing extremism feel relieved. He believes the problem will end by March next year. “Several top Naxalites were eliminated this year. Those who used to fight the state are now surrendering and joining normal development. The number of districts affected by left‑wing extremism has fallen sharply. Areas that were once Naxalite strongholds are now becoming education hubs. Areas once known as the Red Corridor are now growth corridors. Our police and security forces played a big part in this success,” he said. The Raksha Mantri repeated that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi‑led Government is committed to ensuring national security and involves the police in this mission. “For a long time, we did not fully recognize the police’s contributions. But under PM Modi’s leadership, the government built the National Police Memorial in 2018 to honor our police. In addition, the police now have advanced weapons and better facilities. They have modern equipment such as surveillance systems, drones, forensic labs, and digital policing. States are also given enough resources to modernize the police,” he said. Shri Rajnath Singh called for better use of resources, which can only happen through coordination and integration with security agencies. He emphasized that society and police depend on each other and that a balanced relationship between them will make the security system stronger and more alert. “Policing works best when citizens partner and respect the law. When society and police have mutual understanding and responsibility, both benefit,” he added. A joint parade of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and Delhi Police took place as part of the event. The Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri Bandi Sanjay Kumar, Home Secretary Shri Govind Mohan, Director of the Intelligence Bureau Shri Tapan Deka, DG of BSF Shri Daljit Singh Chawdhary, other CAPF heads, retired DGs, and police officers attended the event. **** VK/SR/Savvy",

Prior to arriving at Yokosuka, INS Sahyadri and JMSDF Ships Asahi, Oumi and Submarine Jinryu took part in the sea phase of JAIMEX-25. The sea phase had advanced anti-submarine warfare and missile defence drills, improving teamwork by doing flight operations and replenishment at sea.

The partnership is an important base for keeping peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific sea area. During the harbour part at Yokosuka, crews of INS Sahyadri and the Japanese units will take part in many professional and cultural exchanges. Activities will include visiting each other's decks, joint planning, sharing best practices, and a group yoga session to build friendship and unity. The port visit is also an important interaction as the ship continues its long-range deployment to the Indo-Pacific. Commissioned in 2012, INS Sahyadri shows India's growing effort to build defence tech at home and its vision of ‘ Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ (Self-Reliant India). The stealth frigate with many roles has been in many operations, bilateral and multilateral exercises. India and Japan's strategic partnership has been strong for a long time, focusing on defence and sea cooperation.

                    "content": "Operation Sindoor was a sign of India's strength and ability. It told the world that we are ready to respond to any challenge,\" said Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh during the Naval Commanders’ Conference in New Delhi on October 23, 2025. Raksha Mantri praised the Indian Navy for creating a deterrent posture that made Pakistan stay near its coast. He said the world saw the Navy’s readiness, professional skill and power during the operation. He described the Navy’s presence in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) as giving comfort to friendly nations and discomfort to those who want to destabilise the region. \"IOR has become the centre of modern geopolitics. It is no longer passive; it has become a place of competition and cooperation. The Indian Navy, with its many capabilities, has led the region. In the last six months, our ships, submarines and naval aircraft have been used on an unprecedented scale. The Navy also gave safe passage to about 335 merchant vessels, equal to about 1.2 million metric tons of cargo and a trade value of $5.6 billion. This shows that India is now a trusted and capable partner in the global maritime economy,\" said Shri Rajnath Singh. He said a self-reliant Navy is the base of a confident and powerful country, and thanked the Navy for improving its skills with local equipment and for leading the Aatmanirbhar Bharat movement. \"In the last 10 years, about 67 percent of the Navy’s big purchase contracts were with Indian companies. This shows we no longer rely only on imports. We use our own talent and the skills of MSMEs and start‑ups. The Navy is now working on 194 innovation and indigenisation projects under iDEX, TDF, SPRINT, and Make-in-India. These projects have made the Navy more tech‑independent and have brought private companies and young creators into the mission,\" he said. He said modern warfare is about technology and intelligence. The government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is giving more focus to self‑reliance in defence, local innovation and advanced technologies. \"Maritime readiness is no longer just about ships or submarines. It is about technology‑driven, network‑centric and autonomous systems. We must protect ourselves from the enemy’s modern tech, while improving our own skills in these areas. We have the chance and the skill. We are making our own equipment on our land,\" he said. Raksha Mantri noted that under Aatmanirbhar Bharat, the Indian Navy is not only building defence equipment but also helping build the nation. \"Today, our Navy has become a pioneer in the country’s self‑reliance, innovation and industry. Every ship or submarine built creates a new job; every engine creates a new skill; every local system reduces India’s dependence. Project 17A ships, with more than 75 percent local parts, have created about 1.27 lakh jobs in shipyards like MDL and GRSE. This proves each Navy project connects to security, economy and young people’s jobs,\" he said. He also said the Navy has worked more with MSMEs and small shipyards. Recently, contracts worth about Rs 315 crore were awarded for yard craft, a big step toward the Voice for Local vision. \"The Navy has made many new steps in its aviation sector. Projects like the Multi‑role Maritime Reconnaissance Aircraft, Utility Helicopters, Twin‑engine Deck Fighters, and Naval Shipborne Unmanned Aerial Systems give a new direction to our domestic aviation industry. This not only fills critical gaps but also strengthens self‑reliance,\" he added. Raksha Mantri said it is important to balance strategy and buying the best equipment for modern wars. \"No country can win a war only with equipment and warships. Technology gives an edge, but geography, tricks, timing and human judgement must always be part of the plan. Fleet size and modernisation are important, but using platforms tactically is also key. Agility and adaptability are essential in planning,\" he said. He said we must move the naval strategy and thinking to match the fast changing world. \"We must work together in three areas: capability, people and partnerships. Capability means technology & strength; people means sailors & their families; partnerships mean industry, academia & international cooperation. When these three come together, our Navy will become even more reliable and powerful,\" he said. Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi, Defence Secretary Shri Rajesh Kumar Singh, Secretary DDR&D and Chairman DRDO Dr Samir V. Kamat and naval commanders were at the event. The conference is a chance to talk closely with national leaders and officials, and to fine‑tune the Navy’s view on handling many challenges in the current geo‑strategic environment. The Navy’s top leaders are reviewing readiness on the west and east coasts, boosting local production and innovation under the Make‑in‑India scheme, advancing the government’s vision of MAHASAGAR (Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security Across all Regions) and promoting the Indian Navy as the Preferred Security Partner in the IOR and Indo‑Pacific. ******* SR/VM/Savvy",

Starting from November 01, 2025, the new manual will help the three Services and other units in the Ministry of Defence buy goods worth about Rs 1 lakh crore. He thanked the Ministry of Defence and the HQ Integrated Defence Staff for revising the manual and said it will make processes easier, give consistency, and help the Armed Forces get the equipment and services they need for readiness. It will also give more chances to MSMEs and start‑ups in defence manufacturing and technology, while keeping fairness, transparency and accountability in buying. Dr Mayank Sharma, Financial Advisor (Defence Services), gave a short overview of DPM 2025 and said the manual was made after close talks with the services and other stakeholders. Key points: Some rules have been changed to speed up decisions and make business easier. Liquidated damages (LD) for late delivery of stores and services have been relaxed; a maximum of 10% LD will only apply for very long delays. In cases of indigenisation, only 0.1% LD per week will apply instead of 0.5% per week. There are also rules for guaranteed orders up to five years for items made by public or private companies under indigenisation. The new manual says a Limited Tender enquiry can be used for values up to Rs 50 lakh, and beyond that only in special cases. The rule that requires a ‘No objection certificate’ from the former Ordnance Factory Board before buying from other sources has been removed. The manual lets you plan for a 15% growth of work when repairing ships or overhauling aircraft equipment. This will lower downtime and keep platforms ready. Rules for procurement on a PAC basis (Proprietary Article Certificate) have been updated while keeping its validity at 2 years. All Requests for Proposals (RFPs) issued after November 01, 2025 will follow DPM 2025. RFPs issued before or up to October 31, 2025 will still follow DPM 2009, as amended. RFPs issued earlier but retracted or to be re‑issued on or after November 01, 2025 will follow DPM 2025. The manual is in two volumes. Volume I has the main procurement rules. Volume II has the forms, appendices and government orders referred to in Volume I. Volume I has fourteen chapters, including three new ones: Promoting Self‑reliance through Innovation and Indigenisation, Information and Communication Technology Procurement and Consultancy, and Non‑Consultancy Services. The new chapter on self‑reliance will encourage local design and development of defence items to reach the goal of Aatmanirbharta in defence manufacturing and technology. A PDF copy of the DPM 2025 is available on the MoD website. The ceremony was attended by the Chief of Defence Staff, the Chief of Naval Staff, the Chief of Army Staff, the Defence Secretary, the Secretary of the Department of Defence (R&D), the Chairman of DRDO, the Secretary (Defence Production), the Secretary (Ex‑servicemen Welfare), Dr Mayank Sharma, the Vice Chief of the Air Staff, the Controller General of Defence Accounts, an Officer on Special Duty in the Department of Ex‑servicemen Welfare, and other senior officials. ******** SR/Savvy",

He said the operation is not finished, only paused, and warned Pakistan that a harsher response would come if it attacks again. “Our pilots only showed a small display of India’s power to Pakistan. If they get a chance, they will show our real strength,” he added. He reminded that our enemies are never idle, and urged the Armed Forces to stay alert and ready to take action. Raksha Mantri spoke about how the Armed Forces can help the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi-led Government’s vision to make India a developed, self-reliant nation by 2047. “Our soldiers protect borders and build the nation. This century and the future belong to us; with our progress towards self‑reliance, I am sure our military will become the best in the world,” he said. He also noted the government’s promise to build better border infrastructure. Raksha Mantri said Barakhana represents India’s culture, civilization, and values, where all are treated equally. “Our forces bring together people of many religions, castes, languages, and regions. The diversity shows itself in one shared meal at Barakhana, making it better than any other dinner,” he said. Before the Barakhana, Raksha Mantri opened ‘Shauryavan’, a unique Cacti and Botanical Garden in Jaisalmer. ‘Shauryavan’, an Indian Army project, turns the Thar Desert into an oasis, symbolising resilience, ecology and new ideas. He also paid tribute at the Jaisalmer War Memorial, a ‘Shaurya Gantavya’, under the ‘Bharat Ranbhoomi Darshan’ program. He saw a collection of war trophies and artifacts that tell the story of the Indian Army’s bravery. He watched the first Holographic Light & Sound Show at the Memorial, a modern technology addition that makes the Memorial a top destination. Chief of the Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi, Defence Secretary Shri Rajesh Kumar Singh, Vice Chief of the Army Staff Lieutenant General Pushpendra Singh, all Army Commanders, and other senior officers were present. On October 24, 2025, Raksha Mantri will visit forward areas and watch a new ‘Capability Demonstration Exercise’ by the Southern Command. He will also speak at the Army Commanders’ Conference in Jaisalmer. ******** SR/NA/Savvy/KB",

Since 2008, the Project has built and kept more than 696 km of roads and 1.18 km of large bridges, giving important links to faraway valleys and forward areas in Arunachal Pradesh and meeting the needs of the Armed Forces. A major success was finishing the 278 km Hapoli-Sarli-Huri Road, paved for the first time since independence, linking one of the most isolated parts of Kurung Kumey district. Project Arunank has also used new and green methods like Steel Slag, Cut-and-Cover Tunnels, Geo Cells, Plastic Sheets, GGBFS Concrete and Gabion Walls, making roads stronger and kinder to the environment. Important milestones include upgrading the Hapoli-Sarli-Huri Road to NHDL standards in 2020 and widening the Kimin-Potin Road in 2021. In 2022, a link to Maza, the last area along the Line of Actual Control, was made on December 28, 2022. The TCC-Maza Road will open in November 2025, after the TCC-Taksing Road was finished earlier this year. Also, the Huri-Tapa and Taksing Ghora Camp-Lung OP roads should finish by the end of 2025 under mission-mode work, showing the project’s promise to finish projects on time and strategically. A Motorable Expedition was arranged along the Naharlagun-Joram Top-Sangram-Ziro-Naharlagun route to boost road links and safety awareness. Under the green program ‘Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam,’ 23,850 trees were planted throughout Arunachal Pradesh, showing BRO’s care for the environment. At the event, new welfare steps were started for Casual Paid Labourers, such as better shelters, protective clothes, and regular health camps, acknowledging their important role in BRO’s work. With this strong base, BRO’s future plans will include widening roads, building new bridges and tunnels, and improving high‑altitude links for civilians and defence. Using new tech like geotextiles, slope stabilisation systems, digital monitoring tools and eco-friendly building methods will make roads stronger and safer while cutting long‑term upkeep. ******* SR/KB",

These are the seventh and eighth ships of a series of eight FPVs that GSL is building for the ICG, showing progress in India’s coastal surveillance and response. The FPVs were designed and built entirely by GSL, showing India’s growing shipbuilding strength. They are 52 metres long, weigh 320 tonnes, and use Controllable Pitch Propellers (CPP) – the first of their kind for this class in India – giving better manoeuvring and fuel efficiency. The ships can perform many tasks such as protecting fisheries, patrolling the coast, stopping smuggling and piracy, and rescuing people in distress, especially around India’s islands and Exclusive Economic Zone. The launch was conducted by Smt. Manju Sharma. Dr. Mayank Sharma, Financial Advisor (Defence Services), was the chief guest. Commander, ICG Region (West) Inspector General Bhisham Sharma and other senior officers from ICG and GSL were also present. Dr. Mayank Sharma praised the ICG and GSL, saying the project helps the local industry, creates jobs, and supports MSME ecosystem, and shows how such projects strengthen India’s maritime independence. With these two FPVs added, the ICG is growing its fleet of fast, modern vessels, improving readiness and safety along India’s long coastline. The launch also strengthens GSL’s role as a main builder of next‑generation Indian defence ships. ********** SR/KB",

He also visited the forward areas of Tanot and Laungewala in Rajasthan on October 24, 2025. During the conference, senior leaders of the Indian Army discussed key topics such as Grey Zone Warfare, the plan for joint operations, self‑reliance and innovation. The audience included Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, Chief of the Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi, Defence Secretary Shri Rajesh Kumar Singh, Vice Chief of the Army Staff Lieutenant General Pushpendra Singh and all Army Commanders.\n\nIn his speech, Raksha Mantri described Operation Sindoor as a showcase of India’s military strength and national character. He said the soldiers showed that their power comes not only from weapons but also from their moral discipline and clear strategy. \"Operation Sindoor will be remembered not just as a military action but as a symbol of the nation’s bravery and restraint. Our forces acted with precision and respect for human dignity. The operation is not finished. Our mission for peace will continue as long as any terrorist mind remains alive,\" he added.\n\nShri Rajnath Singh said that Operation Sindoor has created a new way of thinking: India will respond to any terrorist act on its own terms. \"This is India’s new Defence Doctrine, which shows both determination and courage,\" he said.\n\nRaksha Mantri thanked the soldiers for guarding the nation 24X7 and urged them never to underestimate the enemy and to stay alert and ready at all times.\n\nHe called on the Commanders to keep working on defence diplomacy, self‑reliance, information warfare, defence infrastructure and force modernisation to make the Army future‑ready. He praised the professionalism, bravery and resilience of the Indian Armed Forces and confirmed the Government’s promise to give advanced technology, infrastructure and support to keep the Army fully prepared.\n\nShri Rajnath Singh highlighted the Indian Army’s important role in bringing peace and development to Jammu & Kashmir after Article 370 was removed. \"The removal of Article 370 was historic. Today the streets there are filled with hope, not unrest. People feel confident about their future. Most importantly, decision‑making is now in the hands of the local people. The Indian Army has played a key role in this effort,\" he said.\n\nOn the situation along the northern border, Raksha Mantri said that the ongoing talks and steps to reduce tension show India’s balanced and firm foreign policy. \"Our policy is clear: we will keep talking, and we will keep our readiness on the border,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the soldiers’ willpower and discipline, calling it proof that the Indian military is one of the most adaptable forces in the world. \"Whether it’s the freezing icy terrain of Siachen, the hot desert of Rajasthan, or counter‑insurgency in dense forests, our soldiers always show their capability and commitment. Despite tough conditions and varied challenges, they adapt and strengthen national security,\" he said.\n\nRaksha Mantri noted that modern warfare is driven by technology, but the soldiers are still the country’s greatest asset. He said machines boost strength, but the human spirit delivers results. He added that today’s war is fought in invisible realms such as cyberspace, information, electronic disruption and space control, and that quick decisions and soldiers’ willpower are key.\n\nAt the conference, Shri Rajnath Singh also virtually opened new technology hubs called Edge Data Centres at Konark and the Fire & Fury Corps of the Indian Army. By next year, all Corps will have Edge Data Centres across the nation. He launched the Equipment Helpline for the Indian Army, the Sainik Yatri Mitra App and released the Defence Millet Dishes Compendium compiled by the Army Service Corp Centre & College in Bengaluru. He also inaugurated Naman Centres to help veterans and their families.\n\nIn Laungewala, Raksha Mantri laid a wreath at the famous Laungewala Yudh Sthal and paid tribute to the brave hearts of the Indian Army. He opened Chandpuri Hall, an audio‑visual room, in memory of Major (later Brigadier) Kuldip Singh Chandpuri who led the courageous defence during the 1971 Battle of Laungewala. He also congratulated veterans who fought in that battle.\n\nRaksha Mantri reviewed many infrastructure projects aimed at turning the historic site into a national symbol of pride that shows the Indian Army’s valor and resilience. Shri Rajnath Singh also watched a dynamic Capability Demonstration Exercise, showing the integrated use of new units such as the Bhairav Battalion and Ashni Platoon, along with the latest technology brought into the Army for operations. The display highlighted how the Army blends tradition with innovation and focuses on building new skills and modernising its forces.\n*** SR/NA/Savvy",

                    "content": "The Union Minister for Communications and Development of the North Eastern Region, Shri Jyotiraditya M. Scindia, led a Joint Media Briefing today on the One Year Achievements (August 2024 – September 2025) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (MDoNER), the Department of Posts (DoP), and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). The event was attended by Dr. Chandra Sekhar Pemmasani, Minister of State for Communications, Dr. Sukanta Majumdar, Minister of State for Education and DoNER, and Sh. Chanchal Kumar, Secretary MDoNER. With the visionary leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the North Eastern Region has changed a lot in the last year. Speaking to the media, Shri Scindia said he is proud of this progress. He said that, following the Prime Minister’s guidance, the Ministry has worked on Reform, Reach and Results, and has seen record growth in infrastructure, investment, governance, and youth involvement. “Today the Northeast shows the spirit of a new India—strong, connected, and ready for the future. Thanks to the Prime Minister’s vision, the region has moved from a frontier to a front‑runner, showing confidence and competitiveness,” he said. Historic Growth and Economic Potential Shri Scindia talked about the big growth potential of the NE region. He said that over the last decade, the region’s GDP growth has been higher than the national average. He also pointed out the high literacy rate and the large young population, with 70% of people under 28 years old. He added, “All of this makes the region a true growth engine for India.” The Minister said the Ministry spent its highest ever amount, ₹3,447.71 crore, in FY 2024–25. That is a 74.4% rise from the previous year and a growth of over 200% in three years. He said this shows MDoNER’s focus on careful spending, digital tracking, and quick delivery. Weekly reviews, releases of funds in four parts, and digital tracking via the Poorvottar Vikas Setu portal have made the process clear and efficient, covering 97% of projects in inspections and bringing 91% of finished projects into use. Reforms, Governance, and Institutional Strengthening The Ministry has set up Chief Minister‑led Sectoral High‑Level Task Forces in eight areas: tourism, investment, handicrafts, agriculture, infrastructure, sports, the north east economic corridor, and protein self‑reliance. These groups help states work together, align policies, and make sure development is shared across the region, not just within each state. Using an Inter‑Ministerial Facilitation Mechanism, MDoNER has sped up approvals for big infrastructure projects like the expansion of Shillong Airport, a new route for NH‑10 in Sikkim, and the development of Kailashahar Airport in Tripura, strengthening the region’s connectivity. Investment and Economic Integration Shri Scindia highlighted the strong investment momentum of the year. The Rising North East Investors Summit 2025, held at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi, in May 2025, and related events drew eight Chief Ministers, eight Union Ministers, more than 100 ambassadors, and 108 PSUs, leading to investment commitments worth ₹4.48 lakh crore—a historic milestone for the region. The Ashtalakshmi Mahotsav, held on 6‑8 Dec 2024 and opened by the Prime Minister, celebrated the culture of the eight north eastern states and generated investment leads worth ₹2,326 crore. The North East Banker’s Conclave in Agartala, held in December 2024, resulted in 51 new bank branches, more ATM networks, and better MSME credit. Through NEDFi, over 5,300 MSMEs got support and ₹766 crore was raised for start‑ups and businesses, boosting financial inclusion and entrepreneurship. Tourism, Connectivity, and Global Positioning He also talked about MDoNER’s plan to make the Northeast a top global tourism and cultural spot through the Brand Northeast strategy. Every state has chosen special products and experiences—like Muga Silk from Assam, Lakadong Turmeric from Meghalaya, Polo from Manipur, Organic Farming from Sikkim, and Queen Pineapple from Tripura—to showcase its identity. Eight famous tourism spots—Kaziranga, Ziro, Sohra, Thenzawl, Matabari, Kisama, Namchi, and Moirang—are being upgraded into world‑class attractions through public‑private partnerships. Homestay and eco‑tourism options have grown in all states, raising rural incomes by 45% and supporting sustainable livelihoods. Shri Scindia spoke about the need for better connectivity to reach tourism’s full potential. He noted that in the last 11 years, airports grew from 9 in 8 states, with none in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, to 17, including 4 in Arunachal Pradesh alone. He said all NE states will be linked by rail by 2029. Work on the Kaladan and India‑Myanmar‑Thailand Trilateral Highway projects is also underway to connect the NE region with the rest of the world. “The region is becoming India’s gateway rather than the last frontier,” he added. Agriculture, Industry and Entrepreneurship Shri Scindia highlighted the government’s work to diversify the Northeast’s economy with industry‑led agriculture and horticulture. The National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm has started over 68,000 hectares of plantations and set up 47 nurseries and five seed gardens. The Agarwood business has increased its export quota six times and opened an export portal with DGFT, and a GI registration is underway. The bamboo industry, with 22 projects worth ₹126.7 crore, has trained 2,587 artisans and introduced Amazon‑linked market models, linking local crafts to global markets. These actions are creating jobs, boosting exports, and supporting rural entrepreneurship. ***** Samrat/Allen'",

The SCDPM, now in its fifth edition in 2025, continues to focus on making offices cleaner, improving records, and ensuring that pending matters are dealt with on time in all government offices. The SCDPM 5.0, launched nationwide on October 02 this year, will keep up the effort for the whole month of October, in honour of Mahatma Gandhi. The campaign aims to improve how the government works, increase transparency, and deliver better public services. It is led by the DARPG (Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances). Following Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s ‘Swachh Bharat’ vision, MoES, as part of SCDPM 5.0, has run 54 cleanliness drives, reviewed 192 files after looking through more than 500 files and records, handled 3 PMO references, 3 state government references, 2 MP references, and 9 public grievances, and properly disposed of scrap (including e‑waste) that earned over Rs 33.23 lakhs and freed about 8,750 square feet of space. Work has also focused on making rules and processes easier. The review of activities under SCDPM 5.0 across MoES institutions, including regional centres and field units, is overseen by a team led by Joint Secretary MoES Shri D Senthil Pandiyan. They hold regular meetings to monitor progress and solve problems. Nodal officers for SCDPM 5.0 at MoES institutions report daily and give timely updates through the latest digital tools, such as social media, mobile app groups, and the DARPG SCDPM portal for real‑time assessment. “The SCDPM is more than a campaign. It is a promise and a chance to modernise governance and give public services faster, clearer, and more citizen‑focused. We must stay focused on making MoES institutes models of excellent administration,” said Shri Pandiyan. Moving forward, MoES will keep running more cleanliness drives, make office space and work processes more efficient, and promote better disposal of pending matters in line with the government’s goal of transparency, good governance, and public service. **** NKR/AK'",

These changes make intermediaries' duties clearer under the 2000 Information Technology Act (IT Act). In particular, the new Rule 3(1)(d) adds safeguards so that taking down illegal content is done openly, fairly, and with accountability. The updated Rules start on 15th November, 2025. Background: The IT Rules, 2021 were first issued on 25th February, 2021, and amended on 28th October, 2022 and 6th April, 2023. They set duties for intermediaries, such as social‑media platforms, to keep online safety, security, and accountability. Rule 3(1)(d) says intermediaries must delete unlawful information when they know it, either from a court order or a notice from the appropriate government. MeitY’s review found the need for extra safeguards to make senior officials accountable, to describe unlawful content clearly, and to review government orders regularly at a higher level. Key features and expected impact: For details, see the Gazette Notification and the latest IT Rules, 2021 (amended up to October 2025) on https://egazette.gov.in and the MeitY website https://www.meity.gov.in/. ***** Dharmendra Tewari\\\\Navin Sreejith",

This was said by Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav in Cape Town today. He delivered India’s closing statement at the G20 Climate and Environmental Sustainability Working Group Ministerial Meeting in South Africa. The minister expressed deep gratitude to South Africa for its strong leadership and for working hard on complex environmental issues. In his speech, Yadav recalled Mahatma Gandhi and said, ‘Truth must be spoken, heard and accepted. Today we must accept the truth that climate change and environmental damage are real problems before us.’ He added that global challenges can only be met through cooperation, collaboration, and commitment. Repeating his points from the summit’s opening remarks, Yadav said the past decade of the Paris Agreement shows that nothing is impossible. India’s experience shows that growth and environmental protection can move together through a planet‑friendly, people‑friendly model. The minister reminded the audience that G20 countries represent more than 80% of the world’s GDP and population, and therefore must work together as a team, especially to meet the needs of the Global South. He said, ‘Our approach to environmental issues must be practical and inspiring. Practical – to consider each country’s situation, capacity and responsibility. Inspiring – because we owe it to future generations.’ Yadav highlighted India’s climate‑change achievements, noting that the country increased its non‑fossil electricity share to over 50% in 2025, meeting its revised NDC target five years early. For example, solar capacity grew from 2.8 GW in 2014 to 127 GW in 2025, a 45‑fold increase in 11 years. This shows that where there is will, there is a way. As Nelson Mandela once said, ‘It always seems impossible until it’s done,’ Yadav added. He concluded by urging everyone to draw inspiration from great leaders, accept the truth, stay united, trust each other, and work together to improve people’s lives and save the planet.",

The money will be sent through State Biodiversity Boards to three Biodiversity Management Committees: Sakharwadi village, Phaltan Taluk, Satara District, Maharashtra; Kunjirwadi village, Haveli Taluk, Pune; and Kasganj area, Etah District, Uttar Pradesh. Each committee will receive Rs.45.50 lakhs. This move demonstrates the government’s firm commitment to fairness, sustainability, and conservation. The payment is an Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) payment after a company used microbes from soil and industrial waste to make fructo-oligosaccharides products. The funds will be used for activities under Section 44 of the Biological Diversity Act 2002 and related rules. This plan shows the NBA’s active role in recognizing and rewarding local communities that protect India’s biodiversity. By giving benefits back to local people, the NBA helps build a model where conservation and community prosperity grow together. It also meets India’s National Biodiversity Target 13 of the updated NBSAP 2024-2030, which matches the Kunming Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework adopted at CoP-15 of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). ***** VM",

                    "content": "On 16th October 2025, Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman chaired a meeting at Ballari, Karnataka to review the performance of Karnataka Grameena Bank (KaGB). Attendees included Sh. M Nagaraju, Secretary (DFS), Sh. Shaji K.V., Chairman NABARD, ED Canara Bank, and other senior officials from the Department of Financial Services and the Ministry of Finance.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Finance Minister looked at key indicators such as credit growth, NPAs, the bank’s performance in financial inclusion, and how well KaGB implements government-sponsored schemes. She asked KaGB to raise its share of agriculture credit at the grassroots level, especially in emerging economic areas, and directed all stakeholders to unlock the potential of allied agriculture activities in the region. KaGB and Canara Bank were told to work with state government departments to boost credit to MSMEs and allied sectors.\n\nThe rationalisation of GST rates has opened new opportunities in rural areas because consumption has risen, signalling more bank funding, the Minister said. She urged rural banks to use this chance to meet credit needs in semi‑urban and rural areas. She noted that some FPOs receive capital from Development Financial Institutions and government departments, but banks should meet working‑capital needs. Rural banks should tailor their products and services to the convenience and demand of Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs). This will help both banks and FPOs use their resources for mutual benefit and for the sustainable growth of the rural economy.\n\nShe also mentioned that many companies are shifting services like data‑centre services from tier‑1 to tier‑2 and tier‑3 cities. Rural banks should focus on such emerging areas to improve their financial health. KaGB must focus on its operations to become profitable and overcome challenges posed by stressed assets.\n\nThe Minister asked KaGB and its sponsor bank to collaborate with panchayat and district committees to improve the screening of applications under government schemes such as PM‑Vishwakarma and PMFME. She urged KaGB to expand its presence in the Kalyan Karnataka region by opening new branches where banking outlets are scarce. KaGB was advised to boost operational efficiency by improving asset quality, adopting new technology, and strengthening customer service.\n\nSecretary (DFS) Sh. M Nagaraju said that after amalgamation, system and process integration is complete. He stressed KaGB’s medium‑term business plan and its review by the sponsor bank for long‑term sustainability and viability. He highlighted potential in agro‑processing and MSME in the region and urged KaGB to partner with NABARD to add value for farmers in agriculture and allied sectors. He praised KaGB’s progress in Atal Pension Yojana and suggested improving its performance in other financial inclusion schemes such as PMJJBY, PMSBY, and PMJDY. He also suggested a roadmap to partner PSBs to provide banking services in underserved areas. He emphasized the need for staff integration and skill upgrading after amalgamation. ****** NB/AD",

                    "content": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Railways & IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw held a joint press conference on the GST Bachat Utsav in New Delhi today.\n\nShe said Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced at the Red Fort that the Next‑Gen GST Reforms would launch before Diwali. She added that the reforms – lower rates, simpler processes, fewer tax slabs and clear classification – were finished early. The reforms began on the first day of Navratri and people have accepted them well.\n\nThe Finance Minister explained that India started and carried out GST. The opposition never introduced GST or tried to change it. What we do now is a deliberate choice, showing cooperation between the Central Government and the GST Council to give more benefits to citizens.\n\nLowering tax rates helps consumers, and this is what Prime Minister Modi has asked us to do. We have followed this from 2017 to now.\n\nShe added that since September 22 the government has collected data from local levels on all goods. We have been watching the prices of 54 items closely to ensure the new tax rules help consumers. The benefits have reached all 54 items. The Revenue Department is also watching these 54 products during the transition.\n\nGoyal thanked the Prime Minister and Finance Minister for making this year’s Navratri special with the launch of the next‑generation GST on September 22. He said the reform has brought excitement and energy to the country, to ordinary people, industry, business and households.\n\nHe called it the biggest reform since independence, saying the indirect tax system affects 140 crore Indians. The relief of Rs 2.5 lakh crore from both direct and indirect taxes is unprecedented. He noted that the big income‑tax relief announced on February 1 helped people save more and have more disposable income.\n\nHe said, guided by the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister worked on tax reforms for a year and a half, ending with the announcement on 3 September 2025.\n\nHe said the reforms are already boosting investment, business and industry, which has spurred the economy and increased consumer spending. He added that as infrastructure and daily goods become cheaper, the rise in supply and demand drives faster growth, making India the fastest‑growing large economy in the world.\n\nAshwini Vaishnaw said the electronics sector has grown remarkably and GST reforms have boosted consumption, investment and manufacturing. He said the economy shows strong fundamentals from record consumer demand, stable policy and a fast‑growing manufacturing base.\n\nHe added that during Navratri this year, electronics sales rose 20–25% compared to last year. Big retail chains saw record demand for TVs, washing machines, smartphones and air conditioners. 85‑inch TVs sold out completely, and many families upgraded appliances to newer models, showing higher consumer confidence and buying power.\n\nHe said GST reforms gave the economy stability, especially helping middle‑class families by keeping food inflation lower. Food prices fell about 2% in the last four months, keeping household buying power and steady demand.\n\nHigher demand has led to double‑digit growth in electronics manufacturing, creating jobs for more than 25 lakh people.\n\nIndia has also overtaken its neighbor in exporting smartphones to the United States, a huge market. A big global firm now makes 20% of its total production in India, showing India is a top manufacturing choice.\n\nMore demand leads to more investment, which then boosts demand again, creating a positive growth cycle.\n\nHe noted a key milestone: production started at two semiconductor plants – CG Semi and Kaynes – a major step toward India’s semiconductor self‑reliance. With these plants operating, India has entered a new phase in its semiconductor sector, fitting the Prime Minister’s vision of a tech‑empowered, self‑reliant country.\n\nHe said that out of India’s ₹335 lakh crore GDP last year, ₹202 lakh crore was from consumption and ₹98 lakh crore from investment.\n\nGST reforms are clearly visible: consumption grew almost 10% this year, adding about ₹20 lakh crore to spending. This rise should also increase investment, boosting growth and showing how GST reforms strengthen the link between spending and investment.\n\nWatch the GST Bachat Utsav press conference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a610oNnYsak\nOther posts on social media: https://x.com/nsitharamanoffc/status/1979477378783952935 https://x.com/nsitharamanoffc/status/1979483460428275964 https://x.com/nsitharamanoffc/status/1979490241590288400 https://x.com/nsitharamanoffc/status/1979490887940874583 https://x.com/nsitharamanoffc/status/1979492109221597574 https://x.com/AshwiniVaishnaw/status/1979493163481079993 https://x.com/PiyushGoyal/status/1979448718798786664 https://x.com/PiyushGoyal/status/1979476359177982128 https://x.com/PiyushGoyal/status/1979479118283489330 https://x.com/PiyushGoyal/status/1979493568189288510 https://x.com/PiyushGoyal/status/1979500837585174862 https://x.com/mib_india/status/1979477488905380206 https://x.com/mib_india/status/1979474778185400593 https://x.com/mib_india/status/1979491958130393454 https://x.com/mib_india/status/1979487257817227633 **** NB/AD/DT/NS/CNAN/KMN/NS/PK/PV/IB",

A detailed inspection revealed 46,640 pieces of firecrackers hidden behind a thin layer of clothes at the front. The entire shipment, valued at ₹4.82 crore, was seized.

The Act was notified on 15th April 2025 (see Gazette link). It includes 19 changes in five laws: Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934; Banking Regulation Act, 1949; State Bank of India Act, 1955; Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970; and 1980. The notice says the Act will become effective on dates chosen by the Central Government via the Official Gazette, and different parts can start on different dates. The Central Government has set 1st November 2025 as the start date for Sections 10, 11, 12, and 13. The Gazette notice is available at the link below. These sections deal with nomination options for deposit accounts, safe custody items, and bank safety lockers. Key points: The new rules let depositors choose nominees as they wish, while keeping claim settlement uniform, clear, and efficient across banks. The Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules, 2025, which explain how to make, cancel, or list multiple nominees and give the required forms, will be published later to apply these rules in all banks. Earlier, the government set 1st August 2025 as the start date for Sections 3, 4, 5, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20, according to Gazette Notification S.O. 3494(E) dated 29th July 2025 (link below). The Act aims to improve governance in banks, make reporting to the RBI uniform, protect depositors and investors, raise audit quality in public sector banks, and make it easier for customers with better nomination facilities. It also changes the tenure of directors (except the Chairman and full‑time directors) in cooperative banks.

The operation ran from 21 st to 23 rd October 2025. Based on clear information from DRI, officers raided a hidden factory for making methamphetamine at a farm near tall apartment buildings in Greater Noida. They seized 11.40 kg of amphetamine and 110.923 kg of chemicals used to make it. At the same time, they caught the main organizer of the group at his house in Gurugram and found 1.33 kg of amphetamine in his possession. In a quick follow‑up, DRI officers found another location that was thought to store and sell drugs in West Delhi. The site was in a crowded and tight area, which made it hard to operate. During the raid, many people tried to stop the police. Even with aggressive people and the danger of destroying evidence, the DRI team, with help from Delhi Police, handled the situation carefully and did the search. The raid led to many arrests and the recovery of 7.79 kg of cocaine, 1.87 kg of heroin, 3.54 kg of amphetamine, 2 kg of ganja, 0.15 kg of methaqualone and 4.50 kg of chemicals used to make drugs, plus ₹37 lakh in cash that was likely from drug sales. Overall, 16.27 kg of amphetamine, 7.9 kg of cocaine, 1.8 kg of heroin, 2.13 kg of ganja and 115.42 kg of chemicals, worth about ₹108.81 crore on the illegal international market, were seized. In total, 26 foreign citizens were arrested. This tough operation, done across many areas and in hard conditions, shows DRI’s dedication to using intelligence for law enforcement, working with other agencies, and its firm determination to fight drug smuggling and fake drug production. Further investigation is underway. **** NB/KMN",

The goal was to make citizens aware that quick help from witnesses can save lives in heart attacks and other emergencies.\n\nEven though CPR can save lives, the number of people who give CPR in India is below international levels. The week was meant to close this gap by offering more CPR training, spreading awareness, and encouraging people from all groups to be ready to act.\n\nThe week’s aims were to raise awareness that CPR saves lives, give hands‑on training and demos with many partners, get young people to volunteer and help communities, and use online tools to reach many people.\n\nThe week was carried out by many partners nationwide. State and Union Territory health and education departments organized local training. Central government ministries like Home Affairs, Defence, Labour & Employment, Youth Affairs, Sports, Electronics & IT, Higher Education, School Education & Literacy, Railways, Health Research, and NDMA helped reach many people. Central government hospitals, AIIMS, Institutes of National Importance, and other ministries’ institutes ran training sessions. The Indian Red Cross Society used its local centres for community CPR training. Professional bodies ran programs through their state chapters. Online outreach and youth participation were boosted by the MyGov platform of the Ministry of Electronics & IT and the MyBharat platform of the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports.\n\nMany activities were held all week to get people involved. 14,701 people joined the first live pledge and CPR demo on the ECHO platform and YouTube Live. Citizens could also pledge online on MyGov, and 79,870 people signed their commitment. A panel talk on “CPR Techniques and the Role of Bystanders” had six experts from AIIMS New Delhi, Dr. RML Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital, and SGT Medical College. The session was led by the Deputy Director General of Disaster Management Cell and was seen by 10,129 viewers via ECHO and YouTube Live. They also saw a live CPR demo and how to use an Automated External Defibrillator (AED).\n\nAcross India, training in Compression‑only CPR was given by state and UT health departments, Central Government Hospitals, AIIMS, INIs, the Indian Red Cross Society, and professional bodies, teaching 6,06,374 people. At Nirman Bhawan, training for Central Government staff, CISF personnel, housekeeping staff, and ministry officials helped 264 participants.

The Ministry’s Media Cell ran many social media and digital actions, including an educational CPR video on the Ministry’s YouTube channel for States and UTs. Expert interviews in English and Hindi were shared on social media, explaining CPR’s technical details and its importance. Other IEC materials and event promos got high online viewership.\n\nA live CPR demo by experts on 13th October with the Secretary (Health) was covered by news outlets like Doordarshan. A special program called “Total Health – Medical Emergency” aired on DD News on 19th October, showing live compression‑only CPR demos with AIIMS New Delhi experts on the panel.\n\nIn total, more than 7,47,000 citizens were reached during the week, and over 6,06,374 people received hands‑on training.\n\n***** SR HFW-Report on CPR Awareness Week /22nd Oct 2025/1",

The memorial has a central sculpture, the \"Wall of Valour\", and a museum. The 30‑foot high granite statue, a cenotaph, shows strength, resilience, and self‑less service of police. The Wall of Valour engraves the names of those who died, showing respect for their bravery and sacrifice since independence. The museum displays the history of policing in India and continues to grow. The memorial is a place of pilgrimage, a place where police and citizens alike can pay tribute. The National Police Memorial is open to the public every day except Monday. CAPFs hold a band display, parade, and retreat ceremony at the memorial every Saturday and Sunday evening, starting one hour before sunset. Police Commemoration Day, 21 October, is observed nationwide to honour police martyrs. The main ceremony is held at the memorial in New Delhi. Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh will lead the ceremony and honour the martyrs. A joint parade of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and Delhi Police will take place. Raksha Mantri, the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, MPs with police background, heads of CAPFs/CPOs, and others will honour the martyrs by laying wreaths. Retired DGs, police officers, and other dignitaries will also attend. Besides honouring the martyrs, Raksha Mantri will speak to the assembly, remember the fallen, and outline policing challenges. The program ends with Raksha Mantri laying a wreath at the altar for the martyrs of Hot Springs. The event will be broadcast live on Doordarshan, webcast on police websites, and covered by AIR and the media. As part of the remembrance, CAPFs/CPOs organise various commemorative events at the memorial from 22 to 30 October, including visits by families of martyrs, police band display, motorcycle rallies, runs for the martyrs, blood donation camps, essay and painting contests for children, and shows of videos about sacrifice, bravery and police services. Similar programs are held by all police forces across the country during this period. National Police Memorial Chanakyapuri, New Delhi **** RK/AK/PS/PR",

It represents India’s unity, integrity and national solidarity. This year’s observance is especially important as it marks the 150th birth anniversary of Sardar Patel. The celebrations this year are different in many ways and will be memorable. They remind people of Sardar Patel’s key role in creating an independent India and bringing together 562 princely states, which laid the foundation of modern India. Because of his leadership and steady commitment to national unity, Sardar Patel is admired as the \"Architect of National Unity and the Iron Man of India.\" Ekta Nagar, located between the Satpura and Vindhyachal ranges, shows the idea of \"Unity in Diversity\" by mixing natural beauty and cultural richness. This year’s special events will include a grand parade and cultural festival in Ekta Nagar, Narmada district, Gujarat. During the parade, the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and state police will show their skills, discipline and bravery. The National Unity Day parade will have groups from the Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and police from Assam, Tripura, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and the NCC.

The parade will also have a marching team with only Indian breed dogs of the BSF, the Gujarat Police Horse Contingent, the Assam Police Motorcycle Daredevil Show and the BSF Camel Contingent and Camel Mounted Band, which will attract many viewers. Indigenous dog breeds – Rampur Hounds and Mudhol Hounds – will display their skills. These breeds have helped the BSF in many operations and show the spirit of Aatmanirbhar Bharat. At the All India Police Dog Competition, the Mudhol Hound \"Riya\" won first place and will lead the dog squad at this year’s parade. Cadets of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) and school bands will add to the ceremony with striking performances. Young NCC cadets will share the message \"Unity is Strength\" through their discipline and enthusiasm. The Indian Air Force’s Surya Kiran Team will perform a spectacular air show.

Five Shaurya Chakra winners from CRPF and 16 gallantry medal winners from BSF will be seen in the parade. They showed great courage in anti‑Naxal operations in Jharkhand and counter‑terror operations in Jammu & Kashmir. BSF personnel also showed bravery during Operation Sindoor on the western border. Beside the parade, a cultural program organized by the Ministry of Culture, GoI, will showcase 900 artists performing India’s classical dances, highlighting the rich diversity of our culture and national unity. The Rashtriya Ekta Diwas celebrations aim to highlight the spirit of national unity, harmony and patriotism, inspiring people to accept these values.

                    "content": "The Ministry of Mines has issued an amendment to the Mineral (Auction) Rules, 2015. It sets intermediate deadlines for tasks that must be finished after the Letter of Intent (LoI) is issued and before the mining lease is signed. Since the auction system started in 2015, 585 major mineral blocks have been sold, including 34 blocks that the Central government sold. At first, auctions were slow, but in the last three years more than 100 blocks a year have been sold on average. In the first seven months of this year, 112 blocks have already been sold. To match the higher number of auctions, the mines that have been sold must be started quickly to boost mineral output. To do this, the Ministry has taken steps such as regular meetings with the successful bidders, state governments and other stakeholders. It has also set up a PMU to monitor the start‑up of mines. On 17.10.2025, the Ministry released the amendment, adding intermediate deadlines for tasks between the LoI and the lease. Before the amendment, the rules only gave a general period of three years (which could be extended by two more years) to sign the lease from the LoI date. Missing this deadline would cancel the block’s auction. But there was no way to check progress during the stages between the LoI and the lease. So there were few chances for corrections. The new rules now impose intermediate deadlines, and delays will lead to penalties. The penalties are kept reasonable. If the final deadline is met on time, any earlier penalties can be reduced from the auction premium to be paid. The main goal is to get the mine operating on time, not to punish. The amendment also offers rewards for early start‑up. It aims to stop bidders from holding onto blocks without doing work. Key points of the rule change are: - These amendments were made after talking with all relevant stakeholders. ***** Shuhaib T",

                    "content": "The Union Cabinet on 3rd September 2025 approved a ₹1,500 crore incentive scheme for recycling critical minerals. The scheme, part of the National Critical Mineral Mission, aims to give a simple way to keep the supply chain steady in the near future. After talks with stakeholders, the Ministry of Mines released detailed guidelines on 2nd October 2025. The application process for the incentive started on 2nd October 2025. Stakeholders welcomed the quick launch and are actively working with the Ministry. Eligible materials include e‑waste, used lithium‑ion batteries (LIBs), and other scrap such as catalytic converters from old vehicles. Estimates say the country generates about 1.75 million tonnes of e‑waste and about 60 thousand tonnes of used LIBs each year. Customs duty is removed on LIB scrap under the Union Budget 2025‑26, making imports easier. In the next 4‑5 years, the availability of these wastes will grow a lot. Feedstock is also being secured by formalising collection under the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework and by integrating waste into the recycling system with help from government agencies. Under EPR, e‑waste and battery rules require the extraction of specified end products. Still, the country’s capacity to process black mass or powder is limited, so these are exported before the valuable minerals are extracted. The scheme will give incentives to the part of the recycling chain that actually extracts critical minerals, not just to those that produce black mass. This will bring more recyclers, especially dismantlers, crushers and shredders, into the formal system. Many private companies already run efficient scrap collection. Very few companies do full battery scrap to metal recycling (R4). The scheme encourages wider participation and aims to bring more beneficiaries. The total incentive is capped at ₹50 crore for large recyclers and ₹25 crore for small recyclers. The scheme will help increase capacity in recycling using processes like hydrometallurgy. Proven end‑to‑end recycling technologies exist in the country. Top institutes such as IITs, CSIR and other research labs have developed and shown local capabilities in metal extraction, recycling and purification. Some of these institutes also provide training in mineral processing, beneficiation and extractive metallurgy. Any skill needs can be met through partnerships with these institutions. The Ministry of Mines is working closely with the private sector to build enough capacity in the country to fully use e‑waste and recover critical minerals in a few years. **** Shuhaib T",

                    "source": "https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2181433",
                    "content": "India's renewable energy sector is moving into a new stage that focuses on the quality of its systems, not just how fast capacity grows. After ten years of rapid growth, the focus is now on building a strong, controllable, and reliable clean‑energy system that can help India reach its goal of 500 GW of non‑fossil power by 2030. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) says India’s renewable growth is still one of the fastest worldwide, moving from just speed to strong systems, from numbers to quality, and from growth to lasting integration.\n\nA Shift from Quantity to Quality\n\nIn the past ten years, India’s renewable capacity has grown more than five times, from below 35 GW in 2014 to over 197 GW today (not counting large hydro). Such fast growth eventually reaches a point where the next jump needs more than just power; it needs deeper system changes. The sector is now in that phase, where the focus is moving from adding power to using it. We are now dealing with grid integration, energy storage, mixing different sources, and market reforms—these are the real bases for a future with more than 500 GW of non‑fossil power. So, the recent slowdown in adding capacity is a reset—a needed pause so that future growth is steady, controllable, and strong.\n\nIndia’s RE Growth Remains Among the Fastest in the World, Driven by Multi‑Pathway Expansion\n\nMore than 40 GW of awarded renewable projects are now in late stages of getting PPAs, PSAs, or transmission links—showing the sector has a strong pipeline of committed investment. The truth is that India’s renewable market has grown faster than its grid and contractual systems, a common problem for countries going through big energy changes. In this context, enforcing the Renewable Power Purchase Obligation by states and DISCOMs, upgrading transmission lines to move power, and using technology to integrate the grid are top priorities before moving forward with big renewable bids.\n\nIn the current year, Central Renewable Energy Implementing agencies (REIAs) have done bids for 5.6 GW, while State agencies have done bids for 3.5 MW. Additionally Commercial and Industrial Consumers are likely to add nearly 6 GW of renewable energy capacity in calendar year 2025. Thus, capacity addition of RE is progressing through multiple pathways and not necessarily through REIA led bids alone. Global headwinds have also played a role: supply‑chain disruptions, fluctuating module prices, and tighter financing conditions have slowed commissioning timelines. Yet India continues to add 15–25 GW of new renewable capacity annually—a rate that remains among the fastest in the world.\n\nA Deliberate Policy Pivot\n\nOver the past two years, policy attention has consciously shifted from pure capacity growth to system design. Tenders for RE power with energy storage or peak power supply now dominate auctions, signaling a move toward firm and dispatchable green power. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are being integrated at both grid and project levels, marking the emergence of a new market. Domestic manufacturing, incentivised through the Production‑Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, Domestic Content Requirement, imposition of duties, implementation of ALMM, and duty exemptions for capital equipment, is reducing import dependency and creating industrial depth. In addition, the recalibration of GST structures and ALMM provisions represents a strategic consolidation phase, aligning fiscal policy with the twin objectives of domestic value chain depth and technology assurance. Far from being disruptive, these adjustments are designed to stabilise costs, enhance module reliability, and promote scale efficiencies in India’s maturing solar manufacturing ecosystem.\n\nConcurrently, the trajectory of battery storage deployment is advancing through viability gap‑funded projects, sovereign tenders, and emerging storage obligations, establishing the foundation for firm, dispatchable renewable capacity. These measures signal a shift from expansion‑led growth to a more resilient, quality‑driven, and system‑integrated renewable energy architecture. Such transitions take time to yield visible capacity figures, but they represent lasting structural progress—the kind that underpins a robust energy future.\n\nTransmission Reforms Poised to Unlock Over 200 GW of Renewable Potential\n\nTransmission has emerged as the new frontier. India’s grid is being reimagined through the ₹2.4 lakh crore Transmission Plan for 500 GW, linking renewable‑rich states with demand centres. The Government is prioritizing investment in transmission infrastructure through the Green Energy Corridors and new high‑capacity transmission lines from Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Ladakh. While these projects are multi‑year efforts, once operational they will unlock over 200 GW of new renewable capacity. The current stage is therefore temporary—a transition lag, not a structural ceiling.\n\nGovernment has already planned for building HVDC corridors and boosting inter‑regional transmission capacity from 120 GW today to 143 GW by 2027, and 168 GW by 2032. Additionally, the recent amendments to the CERC General Network Access (GNA) Regulations, 2025 have significantly improved the outlook for transmission readiness. The introduction of time‑segmented access—solar‑hours and non‑solar‑hours—allows dynamic sharing of corridors between solar, wind, and storage projects, unlocking idle capacity and easing congestion in RE‑rich states. Provisions for source flexibility, stricter connectivity norms, and greater substation‑level transparency further streamline grid access and curb speculative allocations. These reforms mark a decisive step toward optimising transmission utilisation and fast‑tracking stranded renewable projects, directly addressing one of the sector’s core implementation challenges.\n\nIndia Remains a Magnet for Clean Energy Capital\n\nDespite short‑term delays, India remains a magnet for clean energy capital. Renewable tariffs continue to be among the lowest globally, ensuring long‑term competitiveness. India continues to be one of the most attractive destinations for investment in the clean energy sector, and international interest remains high. Global investors are not exiting India; they are repositioning towards integrated and storage‑backed portfolios. The sector’s fundamentals—strong demand growth, policy continuity, and cost competitiveness—remain firmly intact.\n\nThe Real RE Story: From Expansion to Integration\n\nThe deeper story is one of evolution, not erosion. India’s clean energy transition is entering a phase where the core challenges are about integration, reliability, and scale efficiency. A temporary flattening of the project pipeline in this context is a mark of maturity. The sector is doing the harder work now—synchronising renewables with grid infrastructure, financial discipline, and long‑term market design.\n\nTo complement physical grid expansion, Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs) and other market‑based instruments will play a pivotal role in accelerating renewable energy deployment. VPPAs allow corporate and institutional buyers to contract renewable power virtually—decoupling procurement from physical delivery—thereby deepening demand, providing price certainty to developers, and stimulating private investment in projects awaiting grid connectivity. Coupled with green attribute trading, market‑based ancillary services, and day‑ahead and real‑time market integration, these instruments will create a robust ecosystem for flexible, demand‑driven renewable growth. Such mechanisms are in the process of being strategically incorporated under the Electricity (Amendment) Bill or through CERC market regulations, with enabling policy support from MNRE and MoP, to align corporate procurement, grid flexibility, and national decarbonisation targets.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe next phase of growth is already taking shape: These are the levers that will propel India toward its 2030 targets—not by sheer speed, but by strategic endurance.\n\nViksit Bharat: A Renewable Energy Transition Growing Up\n\nIndia’s clean energy transition is not defined by quarterly numbers but by institutional durability and stickability. After a decade of sprinting, the sector is learning to move forward by synchronising capacity with grid strength, local manufacturing, and financial stability. India’s RE journey is, in a phase of consolidation—one that ensures that when the next acceleration comes, it will be both faster and far more sustainable. India’s renewable story has not lost momentum. It has gained maturity.\n\n*** Navin Sreejith",

This is an important step in the Indian government’s effort to improve inland waterways and support multimodal logistics through a Public‑Private Partnership (PPP). IWAI built the terminal with financial and technical help from the World Bank. The Haldia MMT in West Bengal can handle 3.08 million metric tonnes of cargo each year. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi opened the terminal on 13 January 2023. The terminal is located near National Highway 41 and will soon get rail links, making it easier to move goods by road, rail and water. To run the terminal smoothly, IWAI used a PPP model based on Equip, Operate and Transfer (EOT). The company that will run the terminal was chosen through a public bidding process for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) for 10 years, with an option to extend for another 5 years. IRC Natural Resources won the bid with a royalty of ₹105.03 per tonne of cargo that it handles, paid to IWAI. The start of operations at Haldia MMT is expected to move more cargo on inland waterways, giving a cheaper, greener, and faster way to ship goods, especially to the North Eastern states and Bangladesh. This project fits the government’s goal of making Inland Water Transport (IWT) a reliable and efficient logistics option under the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP). The JMVP aims to expand the 1,390 km stretch of National Waterway‑1 (Ganga–Bhagirathi–Hooghly river system) that goes through Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Under JMVP, IWAI has carried out key work such as keeping the fairways clean, building multi‑modal and inter‑modal terminals, installing modern navigation locks, and adding more than 60 jetties to help river communities. *** GDH/PN/DS",

These vehicles will collect, process, and analyze data about road inventory and pavement condition. The NSVs will gather important information such as surface cracks, potholes, and patches. The data will show road problems, allowing NHAI to fix them and keep highways in better shape. Data from NSV surveys will be uploaded to NHAI’s ‘AI’ based portal called Data Lake. Experts will turn the data into useful knowledge and actionable advice. Data collected regularly, following government rules, will be saved for future use in the Road Asset Management system in the required formats. Pavement surveys will use a 3D laser based NSV system that can automatically detect and report road defects without human help. It uses high‑resolution 360‑degree cameras, DGPS, IMU, and DMI. The system has flexible software to precisely measure and report inventory and pavement data. Data will be collected for all projects with 2, 4, 6, or 8 lanes using NSV before work starts and then every six months. To run this program, NHAI has invited bids from qualified companies. The NSV system is a special tool that uses vehicles with advanced sensors and data tools. These vehicles gather information on road inventory and condition on national highways. The data helps make decisions on pavement maintenance, asset management, and planning, improving safety and efficiency across the country. *** GDH/PN/DS",

                    "content": "Union Minister of State Dr. Jitendra Singh announced that India has made its first home‑grown antibiotic called Nafithromycin. It helps treat lung infections that are hard to cure, and it is especially useful for people with cancer or diabetes that is not well controlled. He said it is the first drug that was fully imagined, made, and tested in India, showing how India can become more self‑sufficient in medicine. The drug was made by the Government of India's Department of Biotechnology together with the well‑known private company Wockhardt. Dr. Singh said this example shows how industry and universities can work together to grow India’s drug industry. He stressed the need to build an innovation system that can run on its own, so India does not need as much government money and can rely more on the private sector and charity to gain worldwide recognition in research. At the start of a 3‑day medical workshop on \"Using AI to Combine and Study Big Biological Data\", Dr. Singh said India must build a self‑sufficient research ecosystem. He explained that countries that are leaders in science do so by creating models that use private investment and cooperation. He also announced that India has a big win in gene therapy. It was the first successful Indian clinical test for treating Hemophilia, carried out by the Department of Biotechnology in a private hospital, Christian Medical College Vellore. Dr. Singh added that India has already read 10,000 human genomes and wants to reach one million. The gene therapy test showed a 60–70% success rate and no bleeding incidents, a major step in India’s medical research. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showing India’s growing leadership in advanced medicine. Speaking at the event, Dr. Singh said the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) is a big step, with ₹50,000 crore planned over five years, of which ₹36,000 crore comes from non‑government sources. This shows a big change in how India does research, making it more like global standards and involving more universities and businesses. He highlighted that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool today, changing how healthcare is given, how government works, and how decisions are made. AI mobile clinics are already helping rural areas get good care. He also mentioned the AI system for complaints made by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG), which resolves complaints 97–98% each week, making people happier and improving service. The Minister praised places like Sir Ganga Ram Hospital for using AI, biotechnology, and genetics together to improve health. He urged more cooperation between government, hospitals, and research institutes to achieve the vision of Viksit Bharat @2047. Dr. Singh said India is entering a new era of independence in biotechnology, AI and genetic medicine. He said that combining innovation, teamwork and care will guide India to become a developed country and lead the world in science and technology.

The workshop was organized together with the Indian National Young Academy of Science (INYAS) through its main program RuSETUp (Rural Science Education Training Utility Programme) and Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak, on 16th October 2025 at MDU, Rohtak. Over 100 teachers from 75 institutions attended the workshop. The event began with a welcome speech by Dr Surender Yadav of MDU and an opening address by Dr Geetha Vani Rayasam, Director of CSIR‑NIScPR, who joined online. She introduced SVASTIK and praised the cooperation of CSIR‑NIScPR, INYAS, and MDU in spreading IKS to regional schools and teachers. Padma Bhushan Dr Anil P. Joshi, Chief Guest and founder of the Himalayan Environmental Studies and Conservation Organization (HESCO), Dehradun, gave a motivational keynote. He talked about how the economy, ecology, and environment are linked and said that Indian traditional knowledge has always focused on sustainability and self‑reliance. He urged teachers to teach science through India’s traditional knowledge. Prof Rajbir Singh, Vice‑Chancellor of MDU, praised the joint work of CSIR‑NIScPR, INYAS, and MDU in promoting interdisciplinary IKS projects. He said that teachers are the first step in sharing knowledge because they can change society. The vote of thanks was delivered by Dr Charu Lata, SVASTIK coordinator, who thanked all leaders, organizers, and participants for their help. She acknowledged the teamwork of CSIR‑NIScPR, INYAS, and MDU in creating a good platform for sharing knowledge. The first technical session, titled \"India’s science & technology heritage: From protection to perpetuation\", focused on India’s rich and diverse scientific heritage and how it continues today. Prof Ranjana Aggarwal, an eminent organic chemist, outstanding scientist of CSIR and former director of CSIR‑NIScPR, stressed that a broad view that blends natural, social, and spiritual sciences is the core of India’s scientific heritage. She warned that false information often misrepresents traditional knowledge online and highlighted the need for clear communication, scientific proof, and educational inclusion. She mentioned projects that record and validate traditional practices in several languages, such as CSIR‑NIScPR’s SVASTIK project, the Ministry of AYUSH, AICTE’s IKS divisions, and NEP 2020. Dr Ashwani Tiwari, Associate Professor at JNU’s School of Environmental Sciences, gave an engaging talk on the importance of traditional rainwater harvesting for India’s water shortage. He encouraged teachers to add this traditional water knowledge to their lessons. Dr Charu Lata, principal scientist of CSIR‑NIScPR, gave a talk on India’s traditional food knowledge. She explained the step‑by‑step process of SVASTIK, from finding and checking traditional practices to sharing them with the public through digital and social media. She invited participants to become \"Brand Ambassadors of SVASTIK\" by sharing local examples of traditional knowledge from their regions. She said that teachers and researchers who link traditional knowledge with verified science are the best at communicating science. The second session began with hands‑on training on how to share traditional knowledge, led by Dr Paramananda Barman, senior scientist and the SVASTIK team from CSIR‑NIScPR. He explained the basics of science communication and its many forms, such as popular science writing, infographics, podcasts, and social media. Participants practiced making communication materials, learning how to design eye‑catching infographics, posters, and short videos about traditional practices. At the end, Dr Raj Mukhopadhyay of ICAR‑Central Soil Salinity Research Institute, Karnal, talked about indigenous soil‑management practices and how they improve soil fertility, microbes, and nutrient cycling. The workshop ended with a feedback session and a vote of thanks. Teachers from schools and colleges thanked the organizers for the enriching experience. In closing, Dr Sandhiya Lakshmanan, senior scientist of CSIR‑NIScPR, thanked all leaders, speakers, and participants for their active participation. ***** NKR/AK",

He said that India’s biotech sector has become a key pillar of national development, adding a lot to the economy through health, farming, the environment, and industry. He added that the government’s plan is to make biotech a driver of economic and social change by linking research institutions, start‑ups, and state governments in a shared innovation system. During the meeting, Dr. Singh also congratulated Ms. Ekta Vishnoi, IRS, a Joint Secretary of DBT, who earned a silver medal at the World Powerlifting Championship. He praised her success as both a personal milestone and a sign of India’s growing strength in global sports. He pointed out that sports today show discipline, resilience, and teamwork – qualities that also push India’s science and technology forward. Ms. Vishnoi’s path, he said, shows the perseverance and passion that define the new India – a country that wants to excel in all areas, from research and innovation to sports and global leadership. Dr. Singh added that DBT’s work in human physiology, metabolic research, and health technologies could help the future of performance science in India, showing how biotech and sports can combine to build a stronger, healthier nation. During the review, DBT officials presented new initiatives to expand bio‑foundries and create new partnerships between research bodies and industry. These bio‑foundries are meant to give a platform for quick design, testing, and scaling of biotechnological solutions, bridging the gap between discovery and use. Dr. Singh highlighted the importance of local engagement to drive the next phase of India’s bio‑innovation movement. He noted that the DBT has begun mapping states by their biotech potential and working with them to set up Bio E3 Cells – part of the larger Bio E3 policy that focuses on entrepreneurship, education, and empowerment in biotech. The goal, he said, is to match national priorities with regional strengths, so states can find their unique opportunities in the biotech chain and grow them through focused action. The Minister urged DBT to deepen its work with state governments, universities, and local industries to unlock biotech’s economic potential at the grassroots level. He also praised the Department’s role in supporting innovation‑led start‑ups and building an ecosystem that encourages young entrepreneurs and researchers to turn ideas into workable solutions. Dr. Singh repeated that biotech can answer many of India’s biggest challenges – from sustainable farming to affordable health care and environmental resilience. The government, he said, is committed to ensuring every region benefits from this scientific progress through coordinated policy, investment, and capacity building. The review ended with a call to speed up project implementation and strengthen inter‑government collaboration, marking a renewed push to make India a global hub for biotech‑driven innovation and sustainable growth. **** NKR/AK",

He called for greater private‑sector involvement, philanthropy and teamwork to meet global standards in health research. He opened the Diabetes Conference \"TREAT‑DM 2025 – Translational Research, Adiposopathy, Technology for Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases\" with a virtual speech at the J N Tata Auditorium.\n\nHe said the era of working alone is over; integration between universities, research and industry is the way forward. He added that the line between public and private has blurred. Because of PM Modi’s reforms, India has opened its space, nuclear and biotechnology sectors to more participants, giving historic results.\n\nIndia’s space economy has grown from less than 10 USD a decade ago to more than 8 billion USD, and is expected to reach 40–45 billion USD in the next ten years. Similar change is happening in other science and tech fields like biotech and biomedical research.\n\nHe highlighted new breakthroughs: India did its first successful homemade gene‑therapy test for Hemophilia, done by the Department of Biotechnology with Christian Medical College, Vellore. The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed a 60–70 percent correction rate and no bleeding after treatment.\n\nHe also said India made its first home‑grown antibiotic Nafithromycin that works against resistant lung infections, especially in diabetic and weak‑immune patients. The drug was made with help from government and industry and is a big step toward Atmanirbhar Bharat in drug making.\n\nHe added that India has succeeded in vaccine research and export. \"Our home‑made DNA vaccine and other vaccines have been sent to almost 200 countries. This shows India’s commitment to self‑reliance and global help – the spirit of Vishwabandhu Bharat,\" he said.\n\nHe highlighted that India’s Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) is set up to get steady funding: ₹50,000 crore for five years, of which ₹36,000 crore will come from non‑government sources. This is a big shift toward a self‑sufficient research model that follows global best practices.\n\nHe mentioned India’s growing role in bio‑manufacturing: it is third in the Indo‑Pacific region and twelfth worldwide. Devices made at institutes such as Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, are exported, showing the success of home‑grown R&D.\n\nHe also mentioned life‑science experiments done on the International Space Station by astronaut Subhanshu Sharma using kits made by the Department of Biotechnology. These studies looked at muscle growth and cell changes from long exposure to electronic environments. \"These are Indian experiments with worldwide impact,\" he said.\n\nHe ended by urging researchers to match their work with the vision of Viksit Bharat @ 2047. He said India’s science and tech growth will come from innovation, self‑reliance and global partnership.\n\nThe first session also had speeches from Dr C. N. Manjunath, Member of Parliament (Bengaluru Rural) and Guest of Honour; Prof. Govindan Rangarajan, Director, IISc; Prof. Navakanta Bhat, Dean, Division of Interdisciplinary Sciences, IISc; Dr Rohit N. Kulkarni, Harvard Medical School; and other top scientists and doctors from India and abroad.",

This campaign focuses more on field and outstation offices along with Ministries, Departments and their subordinate offices under the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG). The preparatory phase ran from 15th to 30th September, 2025. The goal is to make Swachhata (Cleanliness) a regular practice in government offices, improve office conditions, manage space and records efficiently, and clear pending items such as MP references, inter-ministerial references, state government references, public grievances and parliamentary assurances. Special attention is given to e-Waste disposal (unserviceable computers, printers, LED displays, etc.) as per e-Waste Management Rules, 2022. A VC meeting led by Shri M. Subramanian, Joint Secretary, brought together nodal officers of all MSDE institutions to explain the campaign. Every division in a ministry, department or subordinate office must spot cleanliness areas, pending files, redundant material and documents; reduce pending items; show before and after situations; report daily progress through the SCDPM portal; and share best practices, including ways to turn waste into value or art. Since 2nd October, MSDE has actively taken part in Special Campaign 5.0, identifying key tasks such as cleaning sites and clearing record files. A workshop with the National Archives of India was also held to educate ministry and field officers about the importance of record management. Progress is tracked daily. As of 16th October, 2025, 79% of public grievance cases have been resolved. 634 old files—51% of the target—have been reviewed, recorded and eliminated, and 1,900 cleanliness target units have been improved.

It makes up more than half of the country’s GDP and gives jobs to millions of people.\n\nAccurate and detailed data about this sector is essential for smart policymaking, good planning, and wise investment choices. The Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) regularly covers the unincorporated part of the service sector, but we lack consistent information on the incorporated services sector. This gap exists mainly because there is no regular national survey that looks at the different subsectors of incorporated non‑agricultural and non‑manufacturing businesses.\n\nTo fill this void, the National Statistics Office (NSO) under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has planned the Annual Survey of Incorporated Services Sector Enterprises (ASISSE). This survey will use the GSTN data for corporate “Construction,” “Trade,” and “Other Services” (including transport, accommodation and food services, information and communication, health, education, real estate, etc.) as its sampling frame.\n\nBefore starting the full annual survey, a national Pilot Study—called the Annual Survey of Services Sector Enterprises (ASSSE)—was carried out in two phases with the GSTN frame. Phase I (May‑August 2024) tested whether the GSTN database is suitable, updated some frame details, and Phase II (November 2024 to January 2025) examined practical aspects such as enterprise responses, clarity of instructions, questionnaire structure, and data collection feasibility. The Technical Report on this pilot is available on MoSPI’s website at https://mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/TECHNICAL%20REPORT_ASSSE.pdf.\n\nAfter the pilot, a brainstorming session with government, industry, and academic stakeholders took place on 13 August 2025 in Delhi. The session gathered valuable input. Based on the pilot experience and the brainstorming discussion, the ASISSE questionnaire was drafted under the guidance of the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for Enterprise Surveys. The draft questionnaire is now posted on the MoSPI website for public review.\n\nResearchers, policymakers, industry groups, academic institutions, and anyone interested are invited to read the questionnaire and share feedback on its structure, content, and coverage. Your comments will improve the quality, reach, and policy relevance of the upcoming ASISSE. Please send suggestions and comments to nssocpd.coord@mospi.gov.in and tc.dpd@mospi.gov.in by 31 October 2025 using the specific format.

                    "content": "Dehradun: The closing ceremony of the 8th Rashtriya Poshan Maah 2025 was held at the Himalayan Cultural Centre in Dehradun on Friday. Smt. Savitri Thakur, Union Minister of State for Women and Child Development, was the chief guest. The event marked the end of a month-long Jan Andolan focused on nutrition awareness, community participation, and changing habits. Other attendees included Smt. Rekha Arya, Minister for Women Empowerment and Child Development of Uttarakhand; Shri Ganesh Joshi, Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development of Uttarakhand; Shri Lav Agarwal, Additional Secretary, MoWCD, India; Shri Chandresh Kumar Yadav, Secretary, Department of Women Empowerment and Child Development, Uttarakhand; and Smt. Radhika Jha, Joint Secretary, MoWCD, India.\nSmt. Savitri Thakur said, “Nutrition is not just a programme; it is our national duty and moral promise to every child and mother in India.” She noted that Poshan Abhiyaan, launched by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on 8 March 2018, has become a people’s movement that brings together many ministries and citizens under the idea of ‘Empowered Women, Nourished India’. She highlighted the first 1,000 days—from conception to age two—as the most important time for a child’s growth, adding that “a healthy mother gives birth to a strong generation; when every household’s plate is balanced, the nation becomes stronger.”\nShe said women are the base of every family and talked about the theme ‘Healthy Women, Strong Families’. Referring to the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme, she said obesity is a big problem, and Poshan Maah wants to make nutrition a people’s movement with community help. She said this year’s Poshan Maah was very inclusive, with men and youth also joining women. “Today’s well‑nourished children are the citizens of a Suposhit Bharat in 2047,” she said. She praised the ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ campaign and called for action against social evils like child marriage. She thanked states and Union Territories for their active role and lauded Anganwadi workers and field staff, saying the end of the campaign marks a new start for a lasting movement that should reach every household in India.\nShri Lav Agarwal, Additional Secretary, MoWCD, spoke about progress under Mission Poshan 2.0. He said digital governance and real‑time monitoring tools have made service delivery and transparency better. He reported that 14 lakh Anganwadi Centres in 36 States and UTs serve more than 10 crore beneficiaries, including children, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and adolescent girls. He mentioned the Poshan Tracker App has changed service delivery and beneficiary management. More than 13 lakh Anganwadi workers now have smartphones linked to the app, ensuring accurate data and timely nutrition. About 13.87 lakh centres also have growth‑monitoring devices. NFHS‑5 data shows India’s malnutrition indicators have improved: stunting fell from 38.4% to 35.5% and underweight dropped from 35.8% to 32.1%. “These are not just numbers,” Agarwal said, “but signs of hope for millions of children moving from malnutrition to nutrition.” He added that 2 lakh Anganwadi Centres are being upgraded to ‘Saksham Anganwadi Centres’ with safe drinking water, sanitation, ECCE learning materials, and digital tools, building a foundation for Suposhit Bharat 2047. “This is not just about implementing schemes,” he said, “but about nurturing a generation that will be India’s Amrit Peedhi in 2047—healthy, educated, empowered, and compassionate.”\nDuring the ceremony, Smt. Rekha Arya said that nutrition for children and pregnant women is the real strength of a ‘Golden India.’ She praised the government’s efforts, noting that real‑time data through the Poshan Tracker has made service delivery more transparent and accountable, calling it ‘a seal of trust on ground‑level commitment.’ Shri Ganesh Joshi welcomed dignitaries and Anganwadi workers, noting that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, Uttarakhand has seen a big drop in anemia. He talked about 2023 as the International Year of Millets, calling millets a ‘game‑changer’ for nutrition and local farming, and said local produce is the backbone of India’s food self‑reliance.\nSmt. Thakur visited an exhibition by the Department of Women Empowerment and Child Development, Uttarakhand, where she met Anganwadi workers and local producers showing millet‑based items such as Kodou, Kauni, Jhangora etc. She congratulated Poshan Champions and Mission Shakti Champions and gave out Mahalaxmi Kits. She also transferred an amount of 1,56,33,000 as part of the Mukhyamantri Vatsalya Yojana to 5211 beneficiaries of the state through Direct Benefit Transfer. A video message from Union Minister Smt. Annapurna Devi was shown during the programme, where she said that under Poshan Abhiyaan, the Government of India wants every child to be healthy and every mother empowered. She remembered that when Prime Minister Modi launched Poshan Abhiyaan 2025 from Dhar, Madhya Pradesh, he said that ‘Healthy Women, Strong Families, and a Developed India’ are connected pillars of progress. She repeated that since 2018, Poshan Abhiyaan has become a people’s movement, thanks to millions of Anganwadi workers and field officials across India. This year’s 8th Poshan Maah focused on six key themes—Mindful Eating, Early Childhood Care and Education, Nutrition Behaviour for Infants and Young Children, Men’s Participation, Vocal for Local, and Convergence & Digitalization—raising public awareness and laying a visionary foundation for Suposhit Bharat by 2047.",

This program will help that goal and raise awareness about an active life. As I have said before, cycling is a great way to stay fit and reduce pollution. I encourage every Indian to take up cycling and spend at least 30 minutes to one hour on their own fitness.” The “Iron Wheels of Unity” program is an extension of the ‘Fit India Sundays on Cycle’ movement started by Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya, and aims to further promote healthy fitness and caring for the environment. The nationwide trips are expected to cut carbon emissions by more than 100,000 kilograms, showing Fit India’s promise to protect the environment and a healthier country. ***** Rini Choudhury/Anjelina Alexander",

The meeting celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Convention, the only legal global rule that aims to promote fairness and stop doping in sports. The Indian team, led by Shri Hari Ranjan Rao, Secretary of Sports, and Shri Anant Kumar, Director General of the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA), talked with delegates from more than 190 States Parties, plus representatives of the African Union, International Olympic Committee, World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), and other groups. While meeting, India was chosen again as the Vice‑Chair of the Bureau for the Asia‑Pacific (Group IV) for the period 2025–2027. Azerbaijan became Chair of the COP10 Bureau. Brazil, Zambia, and Saudi Arabia were also chosen as Vice‑Chairs for their regions. India also gave in‑kind help by setting up Interactive Boards that show the history of the Anti‑Doping Convention. Over 500 representatives from governments, anti‑doping organisations, and UNESCO permanent delegations were at the meeting. Talks focused on making the Convention run better, funding the Fund for the Elimination of Doping in Sport, and dealing with new problems like gene editing, traditional medicines, and moral issues in sports. The report from the COP9 Bureau and Approval Committee mentioned the need for better coordination, good communication, and teamwork across sectors. India successfully suggested changes to help schools and communities use the Values Education through Sport (VETS) approach to spread sports values, ethics, and fairness to young people, clubs and society. The results of COP10 will help improve the Convention’s rules and effectiveness. The session ended with a renewed pledge from all Parties to promote fairness and integrity in sports.",

The workshop brought Vice Chancellors, institutional leaders and officials from scientific ministries and departments in the Northeast to discuss ways to strengthen India’s R&D system. Prof. Devendra Jalihal, Director of IIT Guwahati, gave the welcome address and urged more collaboration between universities, industry and government to speed up India’s research and development goals. Prof. Vivek Kumar Singh, Programme Director of NITI Aayog, explained the theme of the workshop, noting that making research easier is only the first step; the real aim is to turn scientific results into real‑world applications. In their keynote talks, Dr. Sanghamitra Bandopadhyay, acting Director of ISI Kolkata, and Dr. Vinita Sahay, Director of IIM Bodh Gaya, stressed the need to rethink India’s research landscape, break apart institutional barriers and build industry links. They also highlighted the importance of creating a research‑friendly climate in schools. Dr. V. K. Saraswat, Member of NITI Aayog, shared his views on the future of Indian science and technology. He said states and union territories should identify their strengths and use a cluster approach to grow their R&D ecosystems. He mentioned using the Mohali model for the Northeast, with Guwahati as the main hub, to promote integrated research and innovation clusters. He also suggested launching mission‑mode R&D projects that address the specific challenges of the Northeast to foster inclusive and sustainable growth. In the technical sessions, participants discussed how to simplify processes to improve R&D efficiency and productivity, attract and keep skilled people for R&D, translate lab work into real products (Lab to Land), encourage collaboration and mobility, and measure the ease of doing R&D. Contributions came from top Vice Chancellors and Directors of universities, national laboratories and institutes. The meeting ended with a clear point: India’s scientific progress depends not only on how easy research can be carried out, but on how well it can be turned into real impact. Making research translation central to policy, funding and planning will turn India’s ideas into innovations that boost industry, support self‑reliance and help achieve Viksit Bharat 2047. *** MJPS/SR",

Krishnan, Secretary of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY); Shri S.C.L. Das, Secretary of the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME); Dr. Parvinder Maini, Scientific Secretary of the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser (OPSA); and Mr. Anindya Banerjee, Advisor on Digital Infrastructure in the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nThe three documents were released under the guidance of OPSA and MeitY, and by a multi-stakeholder Advisory Council. The AI for India 2030 project wants to create plans that matter strategically and globally, putting responsible, inclusive, and growth-focused AI at the core of India's digital economy.\n\nIndia's AI progress is about change at the grassroots level. These playbooks come at the right time and give clear ways to make AI inclusive and useful, so new technology brings real help to farmers, business owners, and communities across the country. I ask everyone to work together to use these practical plans for India's growth. The coming together of many departments and programs shown in these reports should keep the momentum going and help AI be used more widely in society, said Prof. Sood.\n\nThe playbooks give clear steps to use AI in India's key sectors, based on many field talks, pilot projects, and feedback from government, industry, start-ups, universities, and farmer groups.\n\nEach document shows a teamwork model that shows what the government, industry, start-ups, and local workers should do.\n\nMr. Purushottam Kaushik, Head of C4IR India, WEF, gave a short summary and explained the method used for the new documents.\n\nBecause these reports focus on real sectors, we have a very useful collection that came from many partners, showing a way forward. This playbook shows how AI can fit smoothly into this change, unlocking new efficiencies, better decisions, and more prosperity for every farmer, said Shri Krishnan.\n\nThe 'Future Farming in India' playbook shows a plan to use AI for millions of farmers, aiming to increase harvests, control risks, and help farmers reach markets. The key is the IMPACT AI framework, which guides teamwork: governments make policy, industry builds solutions in test labs (sandboxes), and local workers give tools to farmers. It uses trusted local networks and local languages to put AI guidance into everyday farming choices.\n\nThe 'Transforming Small Businesses' playbook gives a plan to help India's small firms tackle issues of productivity, getting credit, and finding markets by making AI accessible. The IMPACT AI framework again guides firms from learning about AI, to using experience centres and test labs, to taking action with an AI maturity index, marketplace, tools, and funding, and finally being recognized by honoring pioneers. This cluster approach seeks to spread real AI use across small businesses.\n\n'Focusing on MSMEs is timely and smart. AI uses in these sectors are growing fast. After these documents, we look forward to working with industry partners and start-ups to turn these ideas into real projects that help our small businesses,' said Shri Das.\n\n'OPSA's Science and Technology Clusters can help move the plan in these reports forward. Using their current network, the clusters can build skills and spread knowledge, especially at the start. Also, the International S&T Clusters Conference in December 2025, organized by OPSA, could focus on AI to boost collaboration,' said Dr. Maini.\n\n'AI's power to change agriculture is widely recognized. We are looking at many AI uses in farming, such as digital crop surveys where images and data are combined with AI to improve accuracy and insight,' said Mr. Banerjee.\n\nThe AI Sandbox White Paper describes plans and operations to set up safe spaces for testing and expanding AI, making sure solutions are secure, dependable, and match India's priorities.\n\nThe next steps concentrate on joint action and clear results. State governments, industry groups, tech makers, and financiers will join to create implementation teams that turn playbook ideas into funded projects in farming and main SME groups.\n\nA single monitoring system will watch progress using sector‑specific signs like how much AI is used, productivity increases, cost cuts, better credit access, and improved market reach.\n\nAlso, a special knowledge hub will record and share good examples and success stories, helping continuous learning and spreading good solutions across India's AI network.\n\n**** MJPS/ST",

                    "content": "Key Takeaways\n17 October, 2025\n\nIntroduction\nChhattisgarh is in central India and was formed in 2000 after separating from Madhya Pradesh. It is the country’s 9th largest state and has over 25 million people. The state has many forests and natural resources and is famous for its tribal culture, vibrant festivals, and growing industry. Its crafts – bell metal from Bastar, bamboo from Raigarh, and hand‑woven Kosa silk – show a strong tradition of skill and care for nature.\n\nGST changes give new energy to the economy. Lowering tax on everyday goods and on traditional sectors cuts costs for producers, raises consumer buying, and makes local products stronger in India and abroad. A 5 % GST on handlooms, handicrafts, and dairy lightens the burden on small makers, encourages them to register, and supports the state’s goal of inclusive growth.\n\nCement Industry\nCement and building materials are major in Korba, Raigarh, Bilaspur, Raipur and Naya Raipur, where cities grow fast. The sector brings tax money and helps other businesses. It also employs many people. Cutting GST on cement from 28 % to 18 % lowers building costs, boosts home demand, and creates more jobs in infrastructure.\n\nHandloom & Powerloom\nHandlooms are a key cottage industry in Chhattisgarh and part of India’s big textile job market. The state’s MSME powerloom workers help supply the national industry.\n\nHandloom fabrics are made in Janjgir‑Champa, Raigarh, Raipur, Mahasamund, Bastar and Sarguja. Products include terry towel cloth, cotton handlooms in Raipur, Durg and Bastar, and silk from Janjgir‑Champa and Raigarh. GST at 5 % makes sarees and silk cheaper and more competitive worldwide, boosting exports. It also supports weavers against cheap machine‑made cloth, especially for Kosa and Tussar silk.\n\nPowerloom (mill‑based) weaving is semi‑organized and located in Raigarh, Bilaspur and Janjgir‑Champa, with hubs in Balodabazar, Mahasamund, Raipur, Bastar and Sarguja. Lowering GST from 12 %/18 % to 5 % helps the sector. India’s textile industry, the country’s second biggest employer, benefits from lower taxes, more jobs, better margins and higher export competitiveness. The reforms also ease the tax load on MSMEs, improve working capital and push formalization.\n\nHandicrafts & Traditional Arts\nChhattisgarh’s art includes metal, clay and wood works. Dhokra metal casting, Bastar wood carvings and bell metal objects show strong craftsmanship. Jewelry, textiles and terracotta are also popular, mixing old styles with modern appeal.\n\nTribal & Forest Crafts\nBastar, Kondagaon and Jagdalpur are famous for tribal and forest arts. Artisans make wood items, Dhokra metalwork, wrought iron, bamboo, terracotta and bell metal crafts, reflecting local culture. Cutting GST from 12 %/18 % to 5 % raises demand by 10‑15 % and could add 5 000 jobs by 2026. It improves margins, sales and supports artisans in Self‑Help Groups. Lower tax on raw materials like tendu leaves also helps tribal communities.\n\nMetal Handicrafts\nMetal, bell metal, wrought iron and iron craft are common across Bastar, Raipur and other tribal areas. Bastar Iron Craft (Dhokra) has a Geographical Indication tag, showing its heritage. The sector supports many livelihoods and is promoted under the One District One Product initiative. GST cut from 12 % to 5 % reduces production cost, improves sales and helps exports. It gives financial relief to tribal artisans and keeps traditional skills alive.\n\nPackaged Dairy\nDairy is vital in Raipur, Bilaspur, Durg/Bhilai and tribal cooperatives, especially for women. Chhattisgarh has more than 1 068 dairy cooperatives, many run by women. GST on paneer, curd, yogurt and buttermilk fell from 12 % to 5 %. This is expected to raise consumer demand and require better cold‑chain transport. The policy creates new business chances, supports organized dairy and strengthens women‑led farms.\n\nConclusion\nThe new GST rates on handlooms, handicrafts, metal and forest arts, dairy and cement lower costs, increase buying, and improve competitiveness. They empower women farms, sustain artisans, support industrial jobs, and boost exports. By strengthening livelihoods, preserving traditional skills and opening new business chances, GST reforms drive inclusive growth and help Chhattisgarh build a sustainable future.\n\nReferences\ncgstate.gov.in https://cgstate.gov.in/en\nincredibleindia.gov.in https://www.incredibleindia.gov.in/en/chhattisgarh\ncgapexhandloom.org.in https://www.cgapexhandloom.org.in/portal/about-us\nIBEF https://ibef.org/exports/powerloom-industry-in-india\ntourism.cgstate.gov.in https://tourism.cgstate.gov.in/themes/Ethnic-Tribal\nrepository.tribal.gov.in https://repository.tribal.gov.in/handle/123456789/74989?viewItem=browse\nClick here for pdf file. **** SK/M",

                    "content": "Key Takeaways Introduction\n\nLocated in the Himalayas, Uttarakhand is a state where terraced farms meet spiritual tourism, and old crafts mix with new businesses. From the red rice fields of Purola to the busy homestays of Nainital and Mussoorie, the state’s economy shows a mix of nature, tradition, and business. The new GST rate change gives a timely boost to this hill economy, cutting taxes on agriculture, tourism, crafts, and manufacturing. By lowering rates on important items such as Pahari Toor Dal, Red Rice, Handicrafts, Woolen Clothes, and Hospitality, the reforms aim to make goods cheaper, help small farmers, and bring investment to the state’s green and high‑value sectors. The reform matches Uttarakhand’s goal of sustainable growth, helping people in the hills while strengthening new industrial hubs in the plains.\n\nAgriculture & Local Produce\n\nPahari Toor Dal\n\nGrown in Chamoli, Almora, Tehri, Nainital, and Pithoragarh, Pahari Toor Dal is grown by small rain‑fed farmers as part of the traditional Barahnaja mixed cropping system. It is known for being organic and locally respected, and it is a key ingredient in Uttarakhand’s traditional food. It is grown across 13 hill districts. With the GST rate lowered from 12% to 5%, prices are expected to become cheaper, making Pahari Toor Dal more competitive in organic and health food markets. This change is expected to encourage sustainable hill farming and improve income for small and marginal farmers.\n\nUttarakhand Red Rice\n\nCultivated in Purola and Mori, Uttarakhand Red Rice is known for its traditional value and contribution to hill biodiversity. With the GST rate lowered from 12% to 5%, prices are expected to become more competitive, especially in packaged and health food markets. The change supports nearly 4,000 people directly and indirectly who work in red rice farming, creating local jobs and promoting sustainable hill agriculture.\n\nAlmora Lakhori Mirchi\n\nThe GI‑tagged Lakhori Mirchi from Almora is known for its distinct aroma and flavour. With the GST rate lowered from 12% to 5%, prices are expected to become more competitive, benefiting nearly 5,000 people directly and indirectly involved in its cultivation. The move supports local farmers and strengthens the market presence of this traditional hill spice.\n\nTourism & Cottage Industries\n\nTourism & Homestays\n\nTourism, including hotels and restaurants, contributes 13.57% to Uttarakhand’s GSDP and employs nearly 80,000 people directly and indirectly. With the GST rate on hotel tariffs up to ₹7,500 lowered from 12% to 5%, the reform is expected to make travel cheaper and benefit small hotels, restaurants, and homestays across Nainital, Mussoorie, Auli, Chopta, Munsyari, Haridwar, and Rishikesh.\n\nAipan Art & Decorative Handicrafts\n\nPractised across the Kumaon region, including Almora, Bageshwar, and Nainital, Aipan is a traditional wall and floor art that is now used on bags, wall hangings, and gifts. With the GST rate lowered from 12% to 5%, the reform is expected to benefit around 4,000 people, mainly women‑led businesses, while supporting GI‑tag promotion and expanding local handicraft markets.\n\nHand‑Knitted Woolen Garments\n\nAcross Uttarakhand’s hill districts, locally hand‑knitted sweaters, caps, and socks form an important seasonal cottage industry led by hill women. With the GST rate lowered from 12% to 5%, prices are expected to fall by 6–7%, supporting around 10,000 livelihoods and helping small producers earn better returns during the peak tourist season.\n\nRingal (Hill Bamboo) Craft\n\nProduced mainly in Pithoragarh, Champawat, and Nainital, Ringal, a local dwarf bamboo, is used to make baskets, trays, and other useful items. With the GST rate lowered from 12% to 5%, the reform supports SC/ST communities working in Ringal‑based handicrafts. A study in the Garhwal Himalaya found that about 47.65% of hill families earn some income from Ringal or bamboo craft work, showing its role in sustaining rural livelihoods.\n\nTraditional Woolen Products (Pankhi, Shawls, Stoles)\n\nHandmade from local sheep wool in Chamoli, Uttarkashi, and Bageshwar, these traditional woolen items are part of Uttarakhand’s craft heritage and rural livelihoods. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to boost sales through local fairs and online platforms, helping preserve traditional crafts and support hill women artisans who depend on this seasonal cottage industry.\n\nIndustry & Manufacturing\n\nFood Processing\n\nUttarakhand has 383 registered food processing units, mainly in Rudrapur, employing nearly 30,000 people. The GST rate reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to improve margins, encourage value addition, and promote investment in sectors such as fruit processing, herbal products, and organic foods, strengthening the state’s agro‑industrial base.\n\nAutomobile Sector\n\nThe automobile manufacturing belt across Pantnagar, Rudrapur, Haridwar, and Kashipur employs nearly 50,000 people directly and indirectly. With the GST rate reduced from 28% to 18% on vehicles up to 1200cc (petrol) and 1500cc (diesel), prices are expected to fall by about 8–10%. This will boost local demand, support manufacturers, and create more jobs across the automobile value chain.\n\nMedical Device Park\n\nLocated in the State Infrastructure and Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIDCUL) industrial area, the Medical Device Park employs about 4,000 people in manufacturing. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% on medical devices will lower production costs, boost competitiveness, and encourage investment in the healthcare manufacturing ecosystem, further strengthening Uttarakhand’s MedTech sector.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe GST reforms unlock wide‑range benefits across Uttarakhand’s economy, from small hill farmers growing traditional crops to women artisans keeping Aipan and Ringal crafts alive, and from homestay owners in Rishikesh to industrial workers in Rudrapur. By reducing tax burdens and improving competitiveness, the reforms will strengthen livelihood security, tourism, MSME growth, and green entrepreneurship. Together, these measures link the mountain to the market, advancing Uttarakhand’s vision of inclusive, sustainable, and self‑reliant development.\n\nClick here to see PDF SK/M'",

                    "content": "Key Takeaways Introduction:\nLadakh’s economy depends on its special landscape, culture, and craft skills. Traditional jobs mix with new eco‑friendly businesses. Good Pashmina wool, apricot farms, Thangka paintings, and eco‑tourism all show the region’s talent and history. The new GST cut on many goods and services will help Ladakh’s economy, easing costs for artisans, farmers, and small businesses. These changes will help people earn a living, keep culture alive, and grow Ladakh’s economy sustainably.\n\nHandlooms Pashmina Wool & Products:\nPashmina wool is a very valuable craft in Ladakh. It is made in the Changthang area of Leh and supports more than 10,000 nomadic herders. Pashmina is famous for being warm, soft, and fine, and it is used to make high‑quality shawls, stoles, and clothes. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% will make genuine Ladakhi Pashmina more competitive against imported or machine‑made items. It will also help herders and artisans keep a steady income and could boost export growth.\n\nHandwoven Woolens & Namda Rugs:\nHandwoven woolens and Namda rugs from Leh and Kargil show Ladakh’s rich wool craft tradition. They use yak and sheep wool to make dyed and distinct textiles. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% lowers production costs and encourages people to keep making traditional handicrafts. This benefits local artisans and cooperatives that work with wool and rugs.\n\nWool Felt Products & Woollen Accessories:\nWool felt items and woollen accessories from Leh and Changthang, such as felt boots, hats, and gloves, add to Ladakh’s craft culture. These items are used locally and are also popular with tourists. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% supports small‑scale, seasonal cottage industries that process wool and make products. It is expected to strengthen Ladakh’s economy by increasing incomes for artisans.\n\nTraditional Ladakhi Carpentry:\nTraditional carpentry from Leh and Kargil features intricately carved wooden altars, window frames, and furniture.

                    "content": "Key Takeaways Introduction\\nThe global workforce is changing a lot because of AI, machine learning, data science, and automation. As AI is used in many fields like health care, money, schools, factories, and public work, people need to learn basic AI skills and get special training. The Skilling for AI Readiness (SOAR) program in India is a project by the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) that adds AI skills to India’s schools. It fits the government’s aim to lead in new technology. Launched in July 2025, the program comes at the 10‑year mark of the Skill India Mission, which has helped people since 2015, adding new areas like AI under PMKVY 4.0.\\n\\nSOAR’s Mission: Empowering the Future\\nArtificial Intelligence: Changing India’s Schools\\nAI is changing India’s schools by encouraging new ideas, boosting digital learning, and readying students for a tech world. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 says schools should teach modern subjects like AI at the right ages to grow creativity and digital skills. CBSE already teaches AI in its schools. It started in Class IX in 2019‑2020 and moved to Class XI in 2020‑2021. It focuses on real uses such as skill growth and personalized learning. The Government of India is setting up a Centre for AI Excellence to push AI use in schools. The aim is to use AI for Indian languages, help students think critically, and shift from chalkboards to chipsets. This centre will help the nation build AI tools and people. AICTE‑approved schools are also encouraged to offer AI as a choice. IITs give advanced AI courses like Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Predictive Data Analytics.\\n\\nThe Government is putting AI and digital lessons into the Skill India Mission (SIM) to make a future‑ready workforce. It works through PMKVY 4.0, NAPS, ITIs, NSTIs, and the Skill India Digital Hub (SIDH). PMKVY 4.0 started in 2015, focuses on short training, up‑skilling, and recognizing prior learning, with a focus on future skills like AI. NAPS started in 2016; NAPS‑2 is its second phase and helps apprenticeships.\\n\\nSOAR: Relevance and Expected Outcomes\\nStrategic Alignment with Skill India Mission\\nSOAR backs the Skill India Mission by giving students special modules, giving young people the digital skills needed to get jobs and work better in AI fields. Contribution to Viksit Bharat Vision\\nThe program pushes India’s plan to be a developed country by 2047, using AI for All projects. It creates a tech‑savvy workforce that uses AI to grow innovation and compete worldwide, as seen in national skill plans. Promotion of Digital Inclusion\\nSOAR helps close the city‑rural digital gap by putting AI lessons on open platforms like the Skill India Digital Hub. This gives equal digital skills to all schools, helping poor groups. AI‑Aware Students and Trained Teachers\\nSOAR wants students to understand AI and use it ethically, and to train teachers in government and private schools to improve teaching and make AI common in classrooms. Boosting AI Career Interest and Narrowing Skill Gaps\\nThe SOAR program will raise young people’s interest in AI jobs through hands‑on training. It also reduces the city‑rural gap in digital skills by giving wide training and access to high‑demand tech skills.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe SOAR program is a major step to make India a global leader in AI‑based education and jobs. By putting AI learning in school and vocational courses, SOAR gives students and teachers new skills and builds a culture of new ideas and ethical tech use. With partners and places like the Skill India Digital Hub, the program keeps everyone, no matter their background, able to learn, giving India’s youth power to drive tech and economic growth. As a key part of the Viksit Bharat @ 2047 plan, SOAR builds a digitally fair, competitive, and self‑sufficient India ready to shape future global innovation.

                    "content": "Takeaways: The Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY‑NRLM) is a major program run by the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India. It aims to reduce poverty by helping poor families find good self‑employment and skilled wage jobs, giving them lasting and varied income sources.\nDAY‑NRLM gathers rural poor families into Self‑Help Groups (SHGs). It keeps supporting them in their business activities until they earn more and leave deep poverty.\nDAY‑NRLM’s impact is clear in many rural stories. For example, in Meghalaya, Heinidamanki Kanai started as an entrepreneur after joining the Kyrshanlang Self‑Help Group (SHG) in January 2020. With help from her SHG and the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM), she began making handmade soaps (rose, aloe vera, orange, and lemongrass). Her hard work paid off in August 2023, just a few months after she began her shop in April. Recognizing her talent, she got a bank loan of Rs. 1.8 lakh through her SHG. She used the money to buy new machines, tools, and even ran lab tests to keep her soaps high quality. Her business grew steadily. Her yearly income surpassed Rs. 1 lakh, changing her life and giving her confidence to aim higher. She also taught soap making to other SHG members in her village, sharing knowledge and encouraging others to start their own businesses.\nThe National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) began in 2010 after changing the old Swarnajayanti Grameen Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY). In 2016 it became Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY‑NRLM). Both central and state governments fund it. It is one of the world's biggest programs to lift the poor out of poverty. The Mission reaches its goal by investing in four main areas. DAY‑NRLM builds strong groups like Self‑Help Groups (SHGs) for poor people, especially women. It helps these groups get many financial and livelihood services. The groups get long‑term help to diversify income, raise earnings, and improve life quality. Women in SHGs are trained as community resource persons (CRPs) – such as Krishi Sakhis (agriculture helpers), Pashu Sakhis (animal helpers), Bank Sakhis, Bima Sakhis, and Banking Correspondent Sakhis. The Mission also trains SHG women on topics like domestic violence, women’s education, gender issues, nutrition, sanitation, and health. The SHGs aim to help:\nThe mission’s main goal is to cut poverty by helping poor households, especially women, get financial services, diversify jobs, and live better.\nFinancially, the mission helps women by building community groups that offer finance, technical help, and marketing support.\nDAY‑NRLM has given more than Rs. 11 lakh crores in credit to women SHGs through banks. Women trained as Bank Sakhis and Banking Correspondent Sakhis help SHGs connect with banks. The large credit package, with collateral‑free loans, interest help, and other support, has a very good repayment rate of over 98%, showing the program works well.\nDAY‑NRLM helps with both farm and non‑farm jobs. It supports women farmers, called “Mahila Kisans,” by teaching eco‑friendly farming. It has reached 4.62 crore women. Trained helpers called KrishiSakhi and PashuSakhi work with them all year. The mission also supports small businesses in crafts and food processing through the Start‑up Village Entrepreneurship Program (SVEP), which has helped more than 3.74 lakh businesses. The Mission also trains SHG women on domestic violence, women’s education, gender issues, nutrition, sanitation, and health.\nKrishi Sakhi is an Agriculture Helper (CASP) who gives local support where farm services are hard to get.

                    "content": "Key Takeaways Introduction Tripura is in northeast India. It is famous for its beautiful scenery, lively culture, and rich history. About 60% of its land is forest and 24% is farmland. The state is often called the Daughter of Mother Nature. Its economy still depends a lot on farming and related work. The climate and soil are good for many garden crops like pineapple, jackfruit, and other tropical fruits. Tripura is also known for tea and has good chances for silk farming because of its weather and old silk‑rearing traditions. Handloom weaving, handicrafts, and traditional arts are strong in Tripura. These sectors are getting new chances because GST has lower rates. Lower tax for handloom fabrics, stitched clothes, some teas, and silk products help local makers, weavers, and farmers reach more customers while keeping prices low. The GST changes make the rural economy stronger, create jobs, and keep Tripura’s role in northeast India. Handloom Textiles Handloom weaving is a well‑known industry in Tripura. The Risa and Tripura Pachra‑Rignai textiles have special Geographical Indication (GI) tags. More than 1.3 lakh households make handloom products. Tripura Risa Textile The Risa textile has a GI tag and comes from the Tripuri tribal people. Women in the Killa Mahila Cluster Level Federation in the Gomati district lead the weaving. The craft uses back‑strap looms. Risa cloth is a traditional wrap used as a head‑cloth, shawl, or upper garment for women. It is also given as a gift to respected guests. The Tripura Rural Livelihood Mission supports and promotes Risa textiles. They mainly sell in local markets. The new GST rate is about 5% for fabrics, and stitched clothes priced up to ₹2,500 are now taxed at 5% instead of 12%. This 7‑percentage‑point drop helps Tripura’s local women earn more and keeps the culture alive. Tripura Pachra‑Rignai Textile The Pachra‑Rignai textile also has a GI tag. Women weave it in Gomati, Unakoti, North, West, South, Sepahijala, Khowai, and Dhalai districts. The Rignai is a skirt; the Pachra is a wrap. They are worn daily and at ceremonies. Sales are mainly in the state and at craft fairs, with more online sales growing. GST changes keep the price low: unstitched fabric stays at 5% GST; stitched clothes up to ₹2,500 now have 5% GST instead of 12%. The 7‑percentage‑point cut makes them cheaper and easier to sell. Tea Tripura grows many kinds of tea: black CTC, green, and organic. It is grown in all districts. There are 54 tea estates and 2,755 small growers. The tea is sold through auctions in Guwahati and Kolkata. Some tea reaches northern and western India and local shops. Tripura also exports to Bangladesh, the Middle East, and Europe. GST lowered packaged tea tax from 18% to 5%. This helps lower cost and expands market. Sericulture Silk farming is important for many rural families. In many districts, small farmers grow mulberry and non‑mulberry for silk. About 15,550 farmers grow silk. They handle all steps: cocoons, silk production, and reeling. GST cut from 12% to 5% (a 6.25% benefit) makes silk products cheaper. This helps small producers reach markets and grow income. Food Processing Food processing is driven by small farmers. The main fruit is the GI‑tagged Tripura Queen Pineapple. Farmers also grow jackfruit. Micro and small units under PM‑FME help add value and create jobs. NABARD reports 2,848 units in Tripura. Between FY 2018–19 and FY 2024–25, 73 metric tons of pineapple went to Dubai, Oman, Qatar, Bangladesh, and 15,000 metric tons to other Indian states. GST lowered the tax on fruit and vegetable juices from 12% to 5%. This cuts cost and makes products more affordable. Conclusion Lower GST rates give new energy to Tripura’s traditional and farming sectors. Reducing tax from 12–18% to 5% in handloom, tea, silk, and food processing lowers cost, makes products cheaper, and lets more people buy them. The reforms support tribal women, artisans, and small farmers and help Tripura grow and export. GST is helping the rural economy and keeping Tripura as a key growth spot in northeast India.

                    "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nIntroduction\n\nConnectivity is a bridge that turns places into chances. It is not just about today, but history shows that better links between regions helped those areas grow, trade increase, and the economy become fairer. Even now, connectivity matters for tourism, trade, emergencies, and less reliance on foreign markets.\n\nOne important driver of the growing domestic market is UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik), a regional travel plan that started on 21 October 2016. After nine years, UDAN has moved from a pilot to a national success. It connects distances and lets people across the country fly easily.\n\nIndia’s Aviation: Soaring Towards Inclusive Growth\n\nIn the last decade, India’s skies have become busier than ever. India is now the world’s third‑largest domestic aviation market. The number of airports grew from 74 in 2014 to 163 in 2025. By 2047, when India celebrates 100 years of independence, the government plans to have 350‑400 airports.\n\nThe aviation sector is one of the fastest‑growing parts of India’s economy. It supports air transport services and indirectly helps tourism, trade, logistics, and manufacturing. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), each rupee spent on aviation creates more than three times that value in economic activity and supports more than six times as many jobs in related industries.\n\nToday, the sector directly creates 369,000 jobs and indirectly supports over 7.7 million jobs. The demand for skilled workers—pilots, engineers, ground staff, and logistics professionals—is expected to rise sharply.\n\nWith 116 bilateral Air Service Agreements, India is deepening global links as its carriers expand abroad, strengthening India’s role as an aviation hub in Asia.\n\nCivil aviation also drives FDI inflows, technology transfer, and Make in India initiatives in aircraft manufacturing, ground handling, and Maintenance, Repair, and Operations (MRO) services.\n\nOver the past decade, domestic air passenger traffic grew 10‑12% annually. By 2040, passenger traffic is expected to rise six‑fold to about 1.1 billion. India’s commercial airline fleet is projected to grow from 400 in 2014 to around 2,359 in March 2040. Total employment from aviation in 2040 is expected to reach about 25 million, making it a core engine of India’s journey toward a developed economy.\n\nUDAN: Democratizing Air Travel for Every Citizen\n\nFrom metro cities to mountain valleys, the Indian sky now maps new possibilities—connecting small towns, boosting tourism, and driving local economies. The heart of this change is the UDAN scheme under the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), which has made air travel accessible and reshaped regional connectivity.\n\nAccording to NITI Aayog, domestic travellers accounted for over 83% of total tourism spending in 2019, a figure expected to rise to nearly 89% by 2028. This shift shows how UDAN and similar initiatives have bridged infrastructure gaps and made air travel affordable and reachable for millions.\n\nThis transformation has also changed India’s travel map. Once remote destinations—Kullu, Darbhanga, Hubballi, and Shillong—are now directly connected by air, boosting local economies and regional tourism.\n\nThe vision of UDAN highlighted the need to open air travel to all, a sentiment that sparked a more inclusive aviation sector. This commitment to the common man’s dreams led to the birth of UDAN.\n\nUDAN Achievement: Looking Ahead – Vision For 2047\n\nAs India approaches its centenary of independence, the aviation sector aims for ambitious growth—from 163 airports in 2025 to over 350 by 2047, and passenger traffic expected to cross one billion.\n\nThese goals represent a shift toward cleaner fuels, digital airways, and inclusive mobility. With 25 million jobs projected by 2047 and expanding opportunities in MRO, drone manufacturing, and pilot training, aviation will become a vital pillar of India’s $10 trillion economy.\n\nFollowing initiatives in the aviation sector are key to achieving India’s 2047 vision—connecting remote regions, supporting livelihoods, and advancing sustainable growth.\n\nKrishi UDAN\n\nLaunched in September 2020, Krishi UDAN speeds up transport of agricultural produce and perishables, especially for tribal and northeastern states. In partnership with the Operation Greens Scheme, it offers 50% freight subsidy, multimodal transport options, and coverage of horticulture and allied produce.\n\nLifeline UDAN\n\nThis special initiative started in March 2020, during the COVID‑19 lockdown, to ensure uninterrupted medical and essential supply deliveries. Over 588 flights carried 1,000 tons of cargo across 5.45 lakh km, focusing on the North Eastern region, the Islands, and hilly terrains. Lifeline UDAN also helped set up COVID labs, transport medical teams, and respond to emergencies like the Vishakhapatnam gas leak.\n\nGreenfield Airports Policy\n\nThe Greenfield Airports Policy creates a framework for building new airports on unused land through public‑private partnerships to expand India’s aviation infrastructure and relieve metro hubs.\n\nEnhancing Travel Experience\n\nTo improve travel, reduce delays, and save time, the government launched several initiatives including Digi Yatra. From 2022 onwards, Digi Yatra enabled paperless, contactless processing of passengers using facial recognition technology. By March 2025, more than 52.2 million passengers used this service. The Digi Yatra App is available on Android and iOS platforms and has been downloaded by over 12.1 million users.\n\nFlight Training and Pilot Development\n\nTo meet the projected demand of 30,000–34,000 pilots in the next 10–15 years, the government is expanding Flight Training Organizations (FTOs) and commercial pilot licensing. Promoting gender inclusion, with 13–18% women pilots, DGCA targets 25% female representation in all aviation roles by 2025.\n\nDrone Rules 2021, Production‑Linked Incentive (PLI)\n\nThe Drone Rules, 2021, liberalized India’s drone sector by simplifying regulations and enabling wider commercial use. The Production‑Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, with Rs 34.79 crore disbursed in FY 24–25, has encouraged domestic manufacturing and reduced reliance on imports, boosting India’s self‑reliant drone ecosystem.\n\nBharatiya Vayuyan Adhiniyam, 2024\n\nThis legislative reform modernises India’s aviation sector by re‑enacting the Aircraft Act, 1934, to fit current needs and global standards. The new law supports indigenous manufacturing under Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat, aligns with the Chicago Convention and ICAO, and streamlines regulatory processes such as license issuance. It removes redundancies and provides provisions for appeals.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndia’s civil aviation sector has become one of the fastest‑growing parts of the economy, making the country the third‑largest domestic aviation market worldwide. As the country continues to record unprecedented rises in passenger traffic, expand regional connectivity, and modernise aviation frameworks, the ministry’s efforts improve travel experiences for millions and boost economic prosperity, national integration, and India’s confidence in reaching its goal of becoming a developed nation—Viksit Bharat @2047.\n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.iata.org/en/iata-repository/publications/economic-reports/the-value-of-air-transport-to-india\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2098780\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=152143&ModuleId=3\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2123537\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2066445\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/annex/266/AU669_kOqHSU.pdf?source=pqars#:~:text=Out%20of%20which%2C%20RCS%20flights,economic%20growth%2C%20and%20enhance%20tourism\nhttps://www.iata.org/en/iata-repository/publications/economic-reports/the-value-of-air-transport-to-india\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=154624&ModuleId=3\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?ModuleId=3&NoteId=153352\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1943211#:~:text=Government%20of%20India%20has%20formulated,these%2C%2011%20Greenfield%20airports%20viz\nhttps://sansad.in/getFile/annex/268/AU5_1mFQzx.pdf?source=pqars#:~:text(a)%20&%20(b):,Nadu%20under%20the%20UDAN%20Scheme\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2124459\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1847005\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1989139\nhttps://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1908939\nClick here to see PDF ****** SK/M",

                    "content": "Key Takeaways: Introduction\n\nBlockchain began as a technology linked to cryptocurrencies, but it has now become one of the most important digital changes of the 21st century. Unlike Artificial Intelligence (AI), which depends on huge computing power, blockchain’s strength lies in its ability to prove trust without a middleman.\n\nIndia’s current systems often use single, central databases that can have errors, fraud and low transparency. Blockchain solves these problems with a tamper‑resistant, distributed ledger. Records are kept safely on many computers (nodes). It is almost impossible to change them without notice, so data integrity and trust are much better.\n\nSeeing its big potential, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) created the National Blockchain Framework (NBF). NBF gives a single structure for building blockchain projects across many sectors. It shows how to use blockchain in public services to make them clearer, more responsible and faster.\n\nWhat is Blockchain?\n\nBlockchain is a shared, clear, safe and unchangeable database that works like a ledger of records or transactions. It can’t be tampered with and anyone on the network can see it.\n\nTypes of Blockchain\n\nThe core strengths of blockchain – transparency, immutability, decentralization and trust – are the focus of the National Blockchain Framework. These features let us build secure and efficient digital systems. They are especially important for improving government, better citizen services and reducing bureaucracy.\n\nNational Blockchain Framework: India’s Indigenous Platform for Secure and Scalable Digital Governance\n\nThe National Blockchain Framework (NBF) started in March 2021 with a budget of ₹64.76 crore and was officially launched on 4 September 2024. It is designed to speed up the creation and use of permissioned blockchain applications. This is a key step toward a secure, open and scalable digital infrastructure for India.\n\nTechnology Stack – Vishvasya Blockchain Stack\n\nAt the heart of the NBF is the Vishvasya Blockchain Stack. It is a homegrown, modular platform that gives the technical base for building and running blockchain apps for government.\n\nKey features of Vishvasya Blockchain Stack:\n\n• NBFLite – A sandbox version of the stack for startups and academics. NBFLite lets entrepreneurs, research labs and students try out blockchain in a safe space without needing a full launch. It comes with smart‑contract templates for important government and industry areas such as Supply Chain and Digital Certificates, so users can create and test apps quickly.\n\n• Praamaanik – A new blockchain tool that checks if a mobile app is real and where it came from. In today’s fast‑moving digital world, it is vital to stop harmful apps and fake support. When a user scans an app, Praamaanik compares its details with blockchain records. If it matches, the app is genuine, building trust in the mobile market.\n\nNational Blockchain Portal\n\nThe National Blockchain Portal shows India’s plan for using blockchain in government and business. The site helps people innovate, set standards and use blockchain across different industries. It builds confidence and shows India’s leadership in new technology.\n\nIndia’s NBF is one of the few government projects worldwide that supports blockchain across many sectors.\n\nBlockchain‑Enabled Chains\n\nTransforming Governance, Supply Chains and Justice\n\nIndia is moving toward a trusted digital economy with coordinated work by regulators and tech makers. NBF supplies the core tools for using blockchain in government, supply chains and enterprises.\n\nCertificates and Document Chain\n\nThe current way of giving and using certificates has problems like fake papers and slow service. To fix this, the National Informatics Centre (NIC) uses blockchain to create a “Certificate Chain.” This chain securely stores and retrieves certificates.\n\nOne use is the academic papers of the Central Board of Secondary Education stored on the blockchain. The Document Chain is a single platform that gives issuing bodies and users a standard method for storing and getting any government‑issued document such as caste certificates, income certificates, ration cards, driving licences, birth and death certificates, etc.\n\nMore than 34 crore documents have been verified securely through India’s blockchain platform, including over 48 000 documents in the Document Chain, as of 21 October 2025.\n\nLogistics Chain\n\nThe Logistics Chain gives a safe and clear way to track goods across many stakeholders. Using blockchain, every transaction in the supply chain is recorded on a tamper‑proof ledger, giving traceability and accountability at each step.\n\nOne example is the Online Supply Chain Management System for medicines (Aushada) in Karnataka. Aushada is linked to blockchain to record movements of drugs from manufacturers to hospitals, including quality checks. Patients can view the maker, expiry date and quality of medicine before buying. This traceability reduces the chance of fake drugs, improves accuracy and adds openness.\n\nJudiciary Chain\n\nThe Judiciary Chain uses blockchain to make the justice system clearer, faster and more reliable. It gives a secure, unchangeable and time‑stamped record of court data and documents.\n\nBlockchain helps send notices, summons and bail orders electronically, cutting delays and removing manual steps. As of 21 October 2025, 665 judicial documents have been verified on the blockchain platform.\n\nInter‑Operable Criminal Justice System\n\nBuilding on the Judiciary Chain, the Inter‑Operable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) connects the whole criminal‑justice ecosystem. It gives a single digital platform for case records, evidence and court documents. Over 39 000 ICJS documents have been verified on the blockchain platform, as of 21 October 2025.\n\nProperty Chain\n\nThe blockchain‑powered Property Management System records every property transaction on the ledger. Even when land records are updated or transferred, all parties can see the full history before making decisions. This clarity helps buyers verify ownership, rights and liabilities, cutting lawsuits and speeding up dispute resolution.\n\nAs of 21 October 2025, more than 34 crore property documents are verified through the blockchain platform.\n\nStrategic Roadmap and Regulatory Initiatives for Blockchain Adoption in India\n\nMeitY’s National Strategy on Blockchain shows a plan for developing blockchain technology in India. It tackles challenges and sets short‑term and long‑term goals for using blockchain across different fields.\n\nCentre of Excellence (CoE) in Blockchain Technology (BCT)\n\nThe National Informatics Centre (NIC) has set up a Centre of Excellence (CoE). It helps government departments with advice, training and support for pilot projects before full roll‑out. The CoE supplies blockchain services and ICT infrastructure that let departments connect their systems and use BCT effectively. It has worked with popular blockchain platforms such as Hyperledger Sawtooth, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum – open‑source systems used to build safe and open digital networks.\n\nRole of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) in BCT\n\nTRAI has put blockchain‑based Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) into the telecom world. It requires all Principal Entities (PEs) and Telemarketers (TMs) to register their message transmission chains, letting people see every step of an SMS from the sender to the receiver. This big project, done with regulators and service providers, has made consumer protection stronger, cut spam and shown how blockchain can enforce rules and build trust. It covered over 1.13 lakh entities in partnership with RBI, SEBI, NIC and C‑DAC.\n\nRole of Reserve Bank of India in BCT\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) uses blockchain to upgrade India’s financial system through pilot projects such as the Digital Rupee (e₹). The retail pilot started in December 2022 with a small group of customers and merchants. It shows how blockchain makes payments instant, traceable and clear, while encouraging financial inclusion and new payment ideas.\n\nNSDL’s Adoption of Blockchain for Debenture Covenant Monitoring\n\nThe National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL), India’s biggest depository, launched a DLT‑based blockchain platform for Debenture Covenant Monitoring. This big step modernises India’s capital markets. The platform lets issuers and trustees record asset charges, watch asset cover ratios and track covenants on a secure digital ledger. The ledger is tamper‑proof, cryptographically signed and time‑stamped, giving a clear audit trail and boosting investor confidence.\n\nCapacity Building Initiatives in Blockchain Technology\n\nTo build a skilled workforce in emerging tech like blockchain, MeitY started several training programmes. These aim to make the workforce ready for the future.\n\nSkill Development Programme\n\nThe Capacity Building Division of Digital India Corporation (MeitY) ran Skill Development Programmes for government officials, giving them tech knowledge across departments.

                    "source": "https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2182006",
                    "content": "Key Takeaways\nIntroduction\nKarnataka is at the crossroads of tradition and technology. The smell of Coorg's coffee plantations mixes with the sound of machines in Peenya and Hosur. From the fisheries on the coast of Dakshina Kannada to the craft centers of Mysuru and Bidar, the state's economy shows India's variety, strength, and entrepreneurial spirit. The recent GST changes are a big step for Karnataka. They give relief in agriculture, manufacturing, and services. By lowering taxes on important goods like coffee, dairy, clothing, handicrafts, coir, and essential industrial supplies, the reforms will make things cheaper, boost local demand, and help small businesses and exporters compete. With the new tax structure, farmers, artisans, and business owners in Karnataka will pay less in paperwork, build better supply chains, and reach more markets. The changes match India's aim to simplify taxes and support Karnataka's goal of inclusive, innovation‑led, and sustainable growth.\nCoffee\nKarnataka is the heart of India's coffee industry, producing about 71% of the country's coffee. Its plantations are mainly in Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru, and Hassan. Most growers are small or marginal farmers. About 6.7 lakh people in India grow and process coffee, most of them in Karnataka's Malenadu region. The GST cut from 18% to 5% on coffee extracts, essences, and instant coffee gives a big tax relief. It is expected to lower retail prices by 11–12%. This will increase local demand, give better profits to small processors and cooperatives, and close the gap between India's coffee consumption and that of other countries. Karnataka's shade‑grown Arabica and Robusta varieties – Coorg Arabica, Chikmagalur Arabica, and Bababudangiris Arabica – all have GI tags. They are strongly demanded in Italy, Germany, and Switzerland. The tax cut makes Karnataka's coffee producers more competitive both at home and abroad.\nDairy\nThe Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) leads the state's dairy sector, which is a key part of the rural economy. It supports more than 26 lakh milk producers, most of them small and marginal farmers. With over 15,000 primary dairy co‑ops across Karnataka, including big processing hubs in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Hassan, and Tumakuru, the sector gives jobs to about 22 lakh people in rural and semi‑urban areas. KMF's brand Nandini is a symbol of cooperative success, linking farmers to city shoppers. In FY24, Karnataka produced 13.46 million tonnes of milk, and KMF sold an average of 52.7 lakh litres per day, making it India's second‑largest dairy cooperative. The new GST cuts – from 5% to nil on UHT milk and paneer, and from 12% to 5% on ghee and butter – will lower retail prices by 5–7%, increase demand for value‑added products, and improve cooperative profits. This helps consumers and lets KMF give better, steadier prices to its farmer members, strengthening dairy as a source of rural income and women's empowerment.\nCashew\nIn Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, the coastal districts of Karnataka, cashew processing is a major industry. It is labor‑intensive and employs many women from rural and vulnerable communities. Dakshina Kannada alone has about 66 processing units. The GST cut from 12% to 5% on processed cashew nuts is expected to lower prices by 6–7%. This will give better profits to small processors and exporters. India is a big global player in the cashew trade, exporting kernels to the UAE, Japan, and the Netherlands. The tax change should increase local demand and help keep incomes steady for the coastal women who work in this sector.\nCoir\nThe coir sector, found in Tumakuru, Hassan, Chikkamagaluru, and coastal Karnataka, is a traditional cottage industry that gives important non‑farm jobs, especially to women. It is supported by the Karnataka State Coir Development Corporation and the Central Coir Board. Nationally, about 5.5 lakh people work in coir. Karnataka, a big coconut producer, has great room for growth. India is the world's largest maker and exporter of coir products, mainly to the USA and China. The GST cut from 12% to 5% on coir mats, rugs, and geotextiles will make them 6–7% cheaper, improving competition with synthetic products. The reform promotes a green economy, encourages eco‑friendly coconut husk products, and helps MSMEs grow. It can create a lot more non‑farm jobs, especially for women, supporting national job creation programs like the PMEGP.\nFisheries\nKarnataka has a 320 km long coast that includes Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Uttara Kannada. It supports many traditional fishing families and a strong seafood processing industry that creates many jobs, especially for women. The sector employs lakhs of fishermen and workers in processing plants, cold storage, and export houses. Karnataka is 5th in India's marine fish production. Most fish is eaten locally, but demand for processed seafood such as canned, frozen, and ready‑to‑eat products is growing in India and abroad. The GST cut from 12% to 5% on processed fish and marine products will reduce prices of items like canned tuna, frozen shrimp, and ready‑to‑eat fish curries by about 6–7%. This helps add value in the fisheries chain, encourages local processing, gives more stable jobs, and lessens reliance on changing export markets. By improving competitiveness for seafood MSMEs and cooperatives, the reform directly supports coastal livelihoods and lets fishing communities get more value from this important resource.\nAgricultural Machinery\nLowering GST on tractors, farm machinery, and parts is a big move to boost rural productivity and industry in Karnataka. With more than 78 lakh farmers, most small and marginal, cutting GST from 12% to 5% on tractors and machinery and from 18% to 5% on parts will lower the cost of mechanisation. For example, a tractor costing ₹8 lakh now has GST of ₹40,000 instead of ₹96,000, saving about ₹56,000 for the farmer. This makes equipment easier to buy for farmers, Farmer Producer Organisations, and hiring centres, boosting productivity. Karnataka's industrial hubs in Hubli‑Dharwad, Belagavi, and the Bengaluru automotive corridor will also benefit, as the state has many MSMEs that make tractor parts and machinery. The auto component industry is strong, with companies like Toyota, TVS, Bosch, and others. Demand for farm machinery is likely to grow with the new GST, creating jobs for more than 55,000 workers and raising rural incomes. Linking cheaper machinery with a stronger manufacturing base creates a positive cycle of growth in both rural and industrial areas.\nTextiles and Garments\nThe ready‑made garment (RMG) and textile sector is one of Karnataka's biggest job creators. Major centers are Bengaluru, Ballari, Hubli–Dharwad, and Mandya. Bengaluru is known as the \"Garment Capital of India\" and has more than 400 apparel units that supply global brands like Tommy Hilfiger, Nike, and Adidas. The sector employs about six lakh people, making it the second‑largest textile employer in India. Most workers are women, many from rural and low‑income families. Karnataka provides 20% of India's garment production and 11% of textile exports, worth about ₹4,000 crore, with the United States a top buyer. The new GST rules raise the threshold for the 5% rate from ₹1,000 to ₹2,500 per item, giving big relief to MSME apparel units. The reform reduces tax on more products, makes prices more competitive, and gives manufacturers more working capital. It should strengthen Karnataka's export‑focused garment clusters, boost women's jobs, and drive demand along the whole textile chain, from spinning in Davangere and Belagavi to production in Bengaluru and Ballari.\nGranite\nKarnataka is a major hub for India's granite industry, with quarrying and processing centers in Ramanagara, Chamarajanagar, Ballari, Koppal, and Raichur. The sector gives many jobs to quarry workers, machine operators, and logistics staff, most of whom come from marginalized and tribal groups. Karnataka accounts for about 32% of India's total granite exports, making it a key player worldwide. India mainly exports granite to China as raw blocks. The GST cut from 12% to 5% on granite blocks will reduce processing costs by 6–7%, improving profits for small and medium enterprises. This advantage should make Indian granite more competitive against global producers like Brazil and Norway and encourage more investment in modern machinery, safety, and environmental standards in Karnataka's quarrying areas.\nCement\nKarnataka's cement industry, mainly in Kalaburagi and Ballari, is vital for industrial growth in North Karnataka. It takes advantage of rich limestone deposits and employs many skilled and semi‑skilled workers such as engineers, technicians, and logistics staff, and supports many related services. Major companies like Ultratech Cement and ACC make Karnataka an important supplier to construction and infrastructure projects across South India. The GST cut from 28% to 18% on cement is a major policy change that will lower retail prices by 7–8%. This cost saving will reduce expenses for housing, real estate, and public projects and increase demand for building materials. The growth in construction will create jobs for both skilled and unskilled workers and boost industrial and economic growth throughout Karnataka's industry and construction sectors.\nSandalwood and Soaps\nKarnataka's connection to sandalwood is famous, especially through Mysore Sandal Soap made by Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited (KSDL) in Bengaluru. The soap uses sandalwood oil from across the state, where KSDL has long been the main supplier. The brand is a symbol of Karnataka's skill and heritage. Mysore Sandal Soap has a GI tag and accounts for about 75% of KSDL's revenue. The GST cut from 18% to 5% will lower retail prices by 11–12%, making the soap more competitive against big FMCG companies. The change will boost sales, improve profits, and help modernise and diversify products, keeping the brand a global symbol of Karnataka.\nDrones\nBengaluru is the hub of India's drone industry, with big aerospace companies and many tech startups. The sector employs engineers, software developers, and technicians, driving high‑value innovation and industry diversification. Karnataka was the first state to introduce an aerospace policy, seeing the sector's huge investment potential. Key institutions like Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and ISRO have built a strong technical base for drone work. The GST cut on unmanned aircraft (drones) from 18/28% to 5% gives a big tax break, reducing the cost of locally made drones by 11–20%. This helps drones compete against imports and speeds up use in areas such as agriculture, logistics, infrastructure monitoring, and defence. The reform strengthens Karnataka's leading role in drone manufacturing, creating jobs, advancing technology, and supporting the \"Make in India\" goal.\nIlkal & Udupi Handloom Sarees\nKarnataka's weaving tradition is best seen in Ilkal (Bagalkot) and Udupi, where handloom weaving has been done for many years. The sector supports about 55,000 weaver families, many working from home or in cooperatives. They face problems like changing yarn prices and competition from power looms. Both Ilkal and Udupi sarees have GI tags. Ilkal sarees are famous for the Tope Teni technique that joins the body and pallu warp, and their red silk pallus. Udupi sarees are known for fine cotton and traditional designs. The GST cut from 12% to 5% on handloom sarees will lower prices by 6–7%, making them more competitive against mass‑produced alternatives. The reform should boost sales through cooperatives, government shops, private retailers, and online platforms, improving weaver incomes and keeping Karnataka's handloom tradition alive.\nBidriware\nBidriware comes only from Bidar and is one of India's finest metal crafts. It features silver wire set into a blackened zinc‑copper alloy using special soil from Bidar Fort. Bidriware has a GI tag and shows the skill passed down through many artisan families. The craft gives skilled jobs in the Bidar area, but low pay and competition from machine‑made items hurt workers. The GST cut from 12% to 5% gives a 6–7% price edge, making the handmade items cheaper and more competitive in domestic and tourist export markets. Bidriware is exported to more than 90 countries, so the reform should help artisans earn better, revive interest in the craft, and sustain livelihoods while preserving Karnataka's metal artistry.\nMysore Rosewood Inlay\nThis craft is done by skilled family teams near Mysuru. It is a key part of Karnataka's royal heritage and was supported by the Wodeyar dynasty and Tipu Sultan. The art uses coloured woods, mother‑of‑pearl, and other eco‑friendly materials to decorate rosewood furniture. Ivory used in the past is now replaced by sustainable options. The craft has a GI tag since 2005. Sales come from Cauvery Handicrafts shops, private galleries, and niche exports to the US and UK, with growing online demand. The GST cut from 12% to 5% will lower prices by 6–7%, improving affordability and competitiveness. For example, a rosewood dining set at $4,000 could save more than $250. This tax relief will boost profits for small family businesses, strengthening Mysuru's place in the global market for custom, high‑value wooden art.\nConclusion\nThe GST reforms give wide benefits to Karnataka's economy, from farmers growing coffee, dairy, and cashew to artisans making handlooms and crafts, and entrepreneurs leading industry and technology. Lower taxes cut costs, make products more competitive, and help add value in key sectors, giving more income to people in rural and urban areas. By linking traditional work with modern industry, the changes promote inclusive, job‑focused, and sustainable growth. The reforms are expected to raise productivity, increase local demand, and keep Karnataka as one of India's most dynamic, innovation‑driven state economies.\nClick here to see PDF SK/M'",

                    "content": "Key Takeaways\nIntroduction\nDuring COVID‑19, services such as testing, case detection, surveillance, outbreak management, and critical care were in high demand. The pandemic showed that India must strengthen its health system at all levels—primary, secondary, and tertiary—to respond effectively to future outbreaks, emergencies, and changing health needs.\n\nPandemic Agreement of the World Health Organisation\nIn May 2025, WHO member states adopted the world’s first Pandemic Agreement after three years of negotiations about COVID‑19. The agreement aims to make pandemic responses fairer and to strengthen global coordination for prevention, preparedness, and response. It will help people obtain vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics fairly. The resolution outlines steps toward implementation, such as drafting an annex to create a Pathogen Access and Benefit‑Sharing (PABS) system through an Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG). Once the World Health Assembly adopts it and 60 countries ratify it, the Agreement will enter into force. Member States also directed the IGWG to set up a Coordinating Financial Mechanism for pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response, and the Global Supply Chain and Logistics Network (GSCL) to ensure timely and affordable access to health products during pandemics. The Agreement complements the International Health Regulations, amended last year to improve global outbreak detection and response.\n\nLaunched on October 25, 2021, the Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM‑ABHIM) focuses on health, research, and surveillance infrastructure. Over 2021‑26, the government is investing Rs. 64,180 crore to expand and strengthen primary healthcare institutions, enhance disease surveillance systems, support health research, and build pandemic preparedness. It also helps India achieve universal health coverage by constructing Ayushman Arogya Mandirs, public health labs, and critical care facilities.\n\nPolicy Framework\nPM‑ABHIM strengthens India’s health system by building on the National Health Policy 2017 and linking with the National Health Mission and the Ayushman Bharat scheme. These are major health initiatives of the Government of India. While each program is distinct, they share similar goals and complement one another.\n\nPolicy Foundation: National Health Policy 2017\nThe National Health Policy 2017 stresses the importance of community health systems, with trained first responders working with local governments and community groups. These are crucial for disaster preparedness and public health emergencies. The National Health Mission, launched in 2005, creates community‑owned, decentralized health systems that provide affordable, quality care. It has made significant progress in maternal and child health, disease elimination, and health infrastructure. Its work has been key to India’s health improvements, especially during COVID‑19, and has helped bring better, more accessible care across the country. The 2017 policy reinforced these priorities and set the stage for further enhancement through the Ayushman Bharat scheme, which PM‑ABHIM now builds upon.\n\nAyushman Bharat Scheme\nLaunched in 2018, the Ayushman Bharat scheme builds on the National Health Mission to strengthen primary care through four main pillars. It makes quality healthcare available at all three levels—primary, secondary, and tertiary.\n\nPM‑ABHIM: Key Objectives and Components\nLaunched in 2021, PM‑ABHIM is one of India’s largest national programmes. It aims to build a strong, accessible, and self‑reliant public health system. The mission works from the grassroots to the district level by building and upgrading Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs), Block Public Health Units, Integrated District Public Health Labs, and Critical Care Hospital Blocks in each district. These facilities will close gaps in service and provide comprehensive primary, secondary, and critical care close to people. PM‑ABHIM also focuses on pandemic and disaster readiness by expanding an IT‑enabled, real‑time disease‑watch network that links laboratories at block, district, regional, and national levels to detect, investigate, and stop outbreaks quickly. It encourages health research and innovation, especially on COVID‑19 and other infections, by using the One Health approach, which sees human, animal, and environmental health as connected. The mission also tries to fill gaps in cities and villages by creating Urban Health and Wellness Centres (AAM) in slums and turning Sub‑Centres into AAMs. Together, PM‑ABHIM aims to create a strong health system that can handle future emergencies and give fair, good care to all.\n\nIndia wants to stop the spread of communicable diseases by 2030, achieve universal health coverage, and give everyone safe, affordable medicines and vaccines. These are part of Sustainable Development Goal – 3. The government backs the SDGs.\n\nPM‑ABHIM: Key Initiatives\nUnder its Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS), PM‑ABHIM has made significant progress from FY 2021‑22 to FY 2025‑26. According to recent data, 17,788 Sub‑Health Centres with no buildings are approved to become Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs). 11,024 Urban AAMs (U‑AAMs) are being set up to bring primary care to slums and underserved city areas. 3,382 Block Public Health Units (BPHUs) are being created to strengthen block‑level health work. In every district, 730 Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHLs) are being built to improve testing and surveillance. For top‑level care, 602 Critical Care Hospital Blocks (CCBs) are being set up in districts with more than five lakh people. In total, the government has approved ₹32,928.82 crore for these projects, covering 9,519 AAMs, 5,456 U‑AAMs, 2,151 BPHUs, 744 IPHLs, and 621 CCBs. These moves help create a strong, local, and accessible health network that can give fast, good care to everyone.\n\nAllocation of Resources\nThe money split by year for PM‑ABHIM is shown below. (Numbers are in crore rupees.)\n2021‑22: 9155.97\n2022‑23: 10465.09\n2023‑24: 11015.80\n2024‑25: 13551.30\n2025‑26: 19356.40\nTotal for all years: 63544.56\nPlus 1% for M&E and PMC: 64180\n\nConclusion\nFour years after it started, PM‑ABHIM has transformed India’s health system by spending Rs. 64,180 crore to boost pandemic readiness and emergency help. It upgraded care from village clinics to large hospitals and improved disease‑watch systems, making the health system stronger. As India works toward Universal Health Coverage and SDG‑3, PM‑ABHIM’s focus on communities, working with Ayushman Bharat and global health plans, keeps the country ready to keep people healthy during emergencies.\n\nReferences\nPress Information Bureau: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

In the previous assessment, India was 10th. India also remains 3rd worldwide for annual net gain of forest area. FAO is a UN agency that works to reduce hunger and manage natural resources like forests sustainably. The GFRA is a regular assessment of the world’s forests, giving detailed data on area, changes, management, and use.\n\nGFRA 2025: India in a Global Context\nCountries mentioned: Brazil, Canada, United States, and China.\n\nThe Global Forest Resources Assessment is the only worldwide review based on official national data. It classifies forests into two main types: naturally regenerating and planted. Naturally regenerating forests include primary forests, which have only native species. Planted forests include plantation forests (e.g., rubber) and other planted forests that are not plantations.\n\nIndia has helped increase planted forests, adding to a global total of 10.9 million hectares.\n\nAgroforestry in India\n\nDeforestation and Net Changes\n\"Wood removals\" refer to the amount of wood cut and taken from forests for purposes like roundwood or fuelwood production.\n\nForest emissions and removal trends 1990–2025 (FAO analytical brief)\n\nGlobal scenario, India's achievements, and forest status changes\n\nKey initiatives by the Government of India to boost forest cover:\n1. Budget allocations\n2. National Mission for a Green India (GIM)\n3. National Afforestation Programme\n\nForest cover data shows that the world is making progress: some countries are cutting deforestation, while others are expanding forest area. India’s move to 9th place globally for total forest area, and staying 3rd for net annual gain, shows what strong national commitment can achieve. India’s ongoing work to expand forest cover, promote sustainable forestry, and implement missions like GIM highlights its commitment to protecting the environment and addressing climate change.\n\nReferences:\nPress Information Bureau: Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Government of India: 9. https://moef.gov.in/uploads/pdf-uploads/English_Annual_Report_2024-25.pdf 10. https://moef.gov.in/green-india-mission-gim\nMinistry of External Affairs: 11. https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl%2F38161%2FThe_3rd_Voice_of_Global_South_Summit_2024\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations / Global Forest Data: 12. https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/global-deforestation-slows--but-forests-remain-under-pressure--fao-report-shows/en 13. https://www.fao.org/home/en/ 14. https://www.fao.org/forest-resources-assessment/en/ 15. https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/2dee6e93-1988-4659-aa89-30dd20b43b15/content/FRA-2025/forest-extent-and-change.html#forest-area 16. https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/2dee6e93-1988-4659-aa89-30dd20b43b15/content/cd6709en.html 17. https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/12322cae-5b20-4be2-927a-72a86fd319e9/content 18. https://www.fao.org/4/ae352e/AE352E11.htm\n\nDownload in PDF *** SK/GS",

She said that education is the key to finding chances for growth and development. She noted that St. Thomas College was started to give education mainly to students from rural areas. She was pleased to see the college achieving this aim for 75 years. She said that schools like St. Thomas College are places where futures are made. She expressed joy about its focus on holistic learning and social justice, and that the college promotes values of sustainability and inclusivity. She also mentioned that the college encourages learning with a moral compass. She said that the 21st century is the ‘knowledge century’. Knowledge that drives innovation moves society forward and makes it self‑reliant. The power of literacy, education and knowledge has helped Kerala be a leading state on many human development measures. Speaking about Kottayam, she said the city has seen great social and educational changes. The famous movement against untouchability, known as ‘Vaikom Satyagrah’, happened a hundred years ago. It is called ‘Akshara‑nagari’ because it has been a fountain‑head of literacy and education. The ‘Sakshara Keralam’ movement was strengthened by the active role of people from this area. Shri P.N. Panicker’s great initiative to promote learning through the library movement was inspired by the simple but powerful message ‘Vayichu Valaruga’, meaning ‘Read and Grow’. She highlighted that the light of education shows the way to individual and collective progress. She praised the efforts of St. Thomas College in spreading the light of education. She is confident that St. Thomas College will continue to provide quality education and help build a more equal society and Viksit Bharat by 2047.

Speaking at the event, she said the college has been dedicated to women’s education in India while staying true to spiritual values. This is a great contribution to social change and nation-building. We should deeply honor the vision and legacy of the people who founded and guided this college for a hundred years. The President noted that women from Kerala have led the nation. Fifteen outstanding women of the Constituent Assembly added valuable ideas in making India’s Constitution. Of those, three were from Kerala: Ammu Swaminathan, Annie Mascarene and Dakshayani Velayudan. They influenced discussions on basic rights, social justice and gender equality, as well as other important areas. The first woman to become a High Court Judge in India was Justice Anna Chandy, who in 1956 became a judge in the High Court of Kerala. Justice M. Fathima Beevi made history when she became the first woman judge in the Supreme Court of India in 1989. The President said that the bright women students of St. Teresa’s College represent a young, thriving and vibrant India. She highlighted that women’s active role is essential for the country to use its demographic advantage. She pointed out that the Gender Budget allocation has risen four and a half times in the last decade. Women‑led MSMEs almost doubled between 2011 and 2024. A key goal for achieving a developed India by 2045 is 70% women workforce participation. Women from all parts of society drive India’s progress. She was pleased to note that alumni of this college are contributing positively to the country’s growth. The President was delighted to see that St. Teresa’s College has started a project called SLATE, which promotes Sustainability, Leadership and Agency through Education. She said the project shows the college’s commitment to the National Education Policy 2020. Connecting youth with India’s Sustainable Development Goals and preparing them for future jobs are commendable goals of SLATE.

During the celebrations, getting an appointment letter for a permanent job means double joy: the joy of the festivals and success. Today, this joy has reached more than 51 हजार young people in the country. I can feel how much happiness will be in all of your families. I offer my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family members. I wish you all the best for this new beginning in life. Friends, your enthusiasm, your ability to work hard, and the confidence that comes from seeing your dreams become real – when this is combined with a passion to serve the nation, this success will not be just personal. It will become the nation's success. Today, you have not only received a government appointment but also a chance to make an active contribution to national service. I am confident that you will work with this spirit, honesty, and integrity, and you will play a role in building better systems for future India. And you know, for us 'Nagarik Devo Bhava' is the mantra. With a spirit of service and dedication, we must never forget how to be useful in the life of every citizen. Friends, for the past 11 years, the country has been moving forward with a pledge to build Developed India. The biggest role belongs to our youth, all of you. Therefore, youth empowerment is the priority of the BJP-NDA government. Today, employment fairs have become a means to fulfill the dreams of young people. Through these employment fairs alone, in a short time, more than 11 लाख appointment letters have been issued. Moreover, this effort is not limited to government jobs. We have also launched the 'PM Vikas Bharat Employment Scheme' in the country. The goal under this scheme is to provide jobs to 3.5 करोड़ young people. Friends, today through campaigns like Skill India Mission, youth receive skill training, while initiatives such as the National Career Service Platform connect them with new opportunities. I have been informed that up to now, more than 7 करोड़ vacancies have been communicated to young people through this. These 7 करोड़ vacant positions are not a small figure. Friends, another major step for youth is the 'Pratibha Setu Portal'! Candidates who reach the final UPSC list but are not selected will no longer have their effort wasted. Hence, private and public institutions can invite those youth through this portal, conduct interviews, and provide opportunities. Using youth talent in this way will showcase India's youthful potential to the world. Friends, during this festive season, the GST savings celebration has added new colors. You all know how big the reform in GST rates was in the country. Its impact is not limited to people's savings; the Next Generation GST reforms are also expanding employment opportunities. When everyday items become cheaper, demand also rises. When demand rises, production and the supply chain pick up speed. And when factories produce more, new jobs are created. Therefore, the GST savings celebration is turning into a job celebration. We have just seen how record sales occurred on Dhanteras and Diwali, breaking old records and setting new ones, showing how GST reform has given new momentum to the economy. The MSME sector and retail trade are also witnessing a positive impact of this reform. Hence, many new job opportunities are emerging in manufacturing, logistics, packaging, and distribution. Friends, today India is the youngest country in the world. We regard India's youthful potential as the nation's great strength. We are moving forward in every field with the same mindset and confidence. Even our foreign policy works with the interests of Indian youth in mind. Our diplomatic talks and global MoUs now include training, upskilling, and employment generation for youth. Recently, the Prime Minister of Britain visited India. During this visit, India and Britain agreed to increase investment in sectors such as AI, fintech, and clean energy. A free trade agreement reached a few months ago between India and Britain will also create new opportunities. Similarly, investment partnerships have been formed with many European countries. These could create thousands of new jobs. Agreements with countries such as Brazil, Singapore, Korea, Canada, and others will increase investment, support start-ups and MSMEs, boost exports, and give youth new opportunities to work on global projects, opening many possibilities. Friends, the successes and vision of our country that we discuss today will also have a major role for you in the future. We must continuously work towards the goal of 'Vikas Bharat' (Developed India). Young work‑doers like you will carry this pledge to fruition. During this journey, you can get great help from the iGot Karmayogi Bharat platform. About 1.5 करोड़ employees are learning and upgrading skills through this platform. If you join them, you will develop a new work culture and a sense of good governance. Your efforts will shape India's future, and the dreams of citizens will come true. I once again wish you all success. Thank you very much. *** MJPS/ST/RK",

During the celebrations, getting permanent job offer letters brings double joy – festival cheer and job success. Shri Modi said that more than 51,000 young people across the country felt this happiness today. He congratulated the recipients and their families and wished them all the best for this new start. Shri Modi noted that the new hires are enthusiastic, hardworking and self‑confident. When they also want to serve the country, their success becomes a win for India. He said the new jobs are not just government roles, but chances to help build the country. He is confident the new hires will work honestly and help build a better India for the future. He asked the new hires to remember ‘Nagarik Devo Bhava’ and to work with service and dedication. He said that for 11 years India has been working hard to become developed, and the youth are key. Youth empowerment is a top priority. He said Rozgar Melas help young Indians get jobs, with more than 11 lakh appointment letters given through these Melas recently. He added that these efforts also aim beyond government jobs. The government started the ‘PM Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana’ to give jobs to 3.5 crore youth. The Skill India Mission gives training, and the National Career Service links young people to new jobs. The platform has shared info on over 7 crore vacancies with young people. The Prime Minister launched the ‘Pratibha Setu Portal’, giving chances to UPSC finalists who were not chosen. He said their work will not be wasted, as both private and public sectors are hiring them through the portal. He said using youth talent well will show India’s potential worldwide. He noted that the GST Bachat Utsav has improved the festive season, with big cuts in GST rates nationwide. He said these reforms do more than save consumers; new GST changes also create more jobs. When goods cost less, people buy more, factories make more, and more jobs are created. So the GST Bachat Utsav also becomes an Employment Festival. He said sales during Dhanteras and Diwali broke records, showing GST reforms boost the economy. He said the reforms help MSMEs and retail trade, creating jobs in making, logistics, packaging and delivery. He said India is the world’s youngest country and its youth are a great strength. This belief helps India progress in all areas, even foreign policy, which now considers young people’s interests. He said India’s foreign deals and agreements now include training, upskilling and jobs for young people. He said that when the UK Prime Minister visited, both countries agreed to increase investment in AI, fintech and clean energy. He added the free trade deal with the UK will create more opportunities. Investment deals with European nations are expected to create many new jobs. He said deals with Brazil, Singapore, Korea and Canada will bring investment, help startups and MSMEs, grow exports and give young people chances to work on international projects. He said the new youth will help achieve these goals, and that young workers will lead the way to a developed India. He said the ‘i-Got Karmayogi Bharat Platform’ is useful, and about 1.5 crore government staff already use it. He urged the new hires to join the platform, which will teach them good work habits and governance. He said India’s future and its people’s dreams depend on their work. He wished all appointees again. Speaking to the Rozgar Mela. Congratulating the new hires. https://t.co/ZqoiS3FDJ0 *** MJPS/SR",
