Your task is to translate the following content COMPLETELY into ${target_language}. The translation must be 100% in ${target_language} with NO English words remaining except for the specific exceptions listed below.

TRANSLATION PHILOSOPHY:
- Translate EVERY regular word, phrase, and sentence into ${target_language}
- Use simple, everyday language that ordinary people can easily understand
- Maintain the original meaning and intent
- Make the translation sound natural, fluent, and native
- If content is very long, you may summarize while preserving all key information
- Avoid formal, complex, or technical language unless necessary

DO NOT TRANSLATE (Keep these EXACTLY as they appear in the original):
1. Email addresses (e.g., example@email.com, contact@domain.com)
2. Website URLs and links (e.g., www.example.com, https://example.com)
3. Domain names and web addresses
4. File names with extensions (e.g., document.pdf, report.docx, image.jpg)
5. Phone numbers and contact numbers
6. Dates in numerical format (e.g., 2024-01-15, 15/01/2024)
7. Numbers, percentages, measurements, and currency amounts (e.g., Rs.1,950.80 crore, 50%, 10km)
8. Technical terms, API endpoints, code snippets
9. Usernames and social media handles (e.g., @username)
10. Abbreviations like U.S., UK, UN, NATO, NDRF, SDRF, etc.

- Person names - write them in ${target_language} script/characters

- Place names - write them in ${target_language} script/characters
- Country names - translate to ${target_language}
- Organization names - translate to ${target_language}
- Government department names - translate to ${target_language}
- Scheme and program names - translate to ${target_language}

WHAT MUST BE TRANSLATED:
✓ All common words and phrases
✓ All titles, designations, roles (Prime Minister, Home Minister, etc.)
✓ All person names - write in ${target_language} script
✓ All place names - write in ${target_language} script
✓ All organization and department names
✓ All verbs, adjectives, and descriptive words
